In short , his " Abrams Doctrine " placed essential Army units , and skills , into the Army 's Reserves , which would insure the Army could not be deployed into sustained and extended combat without the public debate necessary before these substantial numbers of critically essential community based Army Reserve personnel and units could be mobilized.

Was this doctrine flawed from the outset ? Does it matter ? Was it avoided as a conscious decision by DoD ? Congress ? The Administration ? Everybody ?
