This particular episode was a morale-killing , perfect example of why it should be made absolutely clear to any single female soldier before she signs the enlistment papers that if she becomes pregnant during the term of her enlistment , she faces immediate discharge. She should understand that she will be responsible for her own prenatal care and childcare after that. To allow otherwise results in an inability to meet the commitment that was made not only to the Army , but to the soldiers with whom this person was supposed to serve. This was a completely preventable situation to start with , one based on a conscious decision made by this young woman. The money and resources for military medical care and childcare services are meant for soldiers who serve their enlistment , and for their dependents. The Department of Defense is not a nursery for single mothers. This is not an isolated incident in the military community. It is only one of many similar incidents , but this one happened to make it into the news. And by the way , God bless the soldier who had to deploy in this woman 's place .
