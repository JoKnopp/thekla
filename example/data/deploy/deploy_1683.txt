However , the advantage of the Aruna route was that it would allow the Egyptian army to debouch onto the Plain of Esdraelon less than a mile from the city of Megiddo. Also , many modern commentators , and perhaps the Canaanite collation as well , seem to forget the major virtues of the Egyptian Chariots. They were light vehicles , and it was certainly conceivable that many could be carried through the pass , while the horses were led separately. Furthermore , Tuthmosis III and his generals must have known , through reconnaissance , that the coalition forces , and particularly their chariotry , were deployed to cover the approaches of the two easier routes to Megiddo ( particularly the one from Taanakh ) . The Canaanite alliance would have been ideally positioned to attack the Egyptian forces had they entered the plain along the Taanakh approach , first by mass chariot attacks and then with a process of attrition of the Egyptian infantry by long range archery. Thus , even before the Egyptian army was finally able to deploy for battle , they would have already inflicted very heavy losses .
