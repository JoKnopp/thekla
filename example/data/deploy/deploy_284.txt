The balance between deployed forces and continental United States ( CONUS ) -based forces was one of several force structure issues drawing Army attention. Planners considered heavy-versus-light forces , combat-versus-support forces , and active-versus-reserve units in planning the most effective Army structure. As Lt. Gen. Fred K. Mahaffey , Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Plans ( DCSOPS ) , noted in October 1984 , " This concept of proper force balance does not imply equal parts , but rather the achievement of optimal ratios between the various components of balance necessary to meet our strategic requirements. " ( Army , Oct 84 ) During FY 84 , planners continued to study the proper force balance , a task that covered rapidly changing facets of the Total Army occasioned by revised doctrine , force structure , equipment , training , funding , and missions. The steadily increasing quantitative and qualitative improvement in the Warsaw Pact armies naturally affected the determination of U.S. Army force balance .
