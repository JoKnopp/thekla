With funding from the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) , NCAR scientist Larry Cornman and his colleagues have created software that works with an aircraft 's existing equipment to measure and report in-situ ( in-flight ) turbulence once every minute. United Airlines expects to deploy the software on more than 200 aircraft over the next six months. The data will be used to create turbulence forecasts to help pilots steer clear of bumpy air. NCAR 's primary sponsor is the National Science Foundation .
