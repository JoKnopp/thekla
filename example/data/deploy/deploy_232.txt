The illustrative embodiments takes actions by reconfiguring and/or redeploying one or more service components and resources so the requested service can be deployed with the desired configuration. The illustrative embodiments create an active object to manage the new software service using an active template based on the analysis. Finally , the illustrative embodiments deploy the new software service in the network using the active object and manage the new software service using the active object. The active objects in the active repository interact with one another while controlling and managing the software services. These interactions lead to service management actions such that desired service compositions are realized by the component software services and the compositions are maintained in their desired states .
