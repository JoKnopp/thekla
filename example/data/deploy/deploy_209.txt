After the airbags have stopped rolling , they will be deflated and retracted , exposing the lander. Small motor engines will drive open the lander 's petals , like a flower , and stand it upright , revealing the rover and the science instruments. As the sun rises , the spacecraft will power up , drawing on the energy from its solar panels to spring to life. The lander 's camera will take its first look and locate the directon of the sun. The communications antenna 's will be deployed , and two ramps will unfurl to allow for the rover 's exit .
