With the popularity of the personal computer in the 1980 ' s , users began making room next to their dumb terminals for PC ' s , to take advantage of the first word processors and spreadsheet applications. The graphical user interface ( GUI ) made personal computing even more productive and it became clear that it was here to stay. The impact on enterprise software was a concept called client/server computing. This early form of distributed computing involved software running on a server as well as on each desktop ( i.e. client ) computer. These new graphical client programs were more productive for users and could take advantage of client computing power , but were incredibly expensive to develop and deploy , requiring software to be distributed to hundreds or thousands of computers whenever a change was made to the client code. Many early adopters regretted their foray into client/server computing and others learned from what they saw and avoided the client/server phase completely .
