Abstract : The term iWarp indicates a set of published protocol specifications that provide remote read and write access to user applications , without operating system intervention or intermediate data copies. The iWarp protocol provides for higher bandwidth and lower latency transfers over existing , widely deployed TCP/IP networks. While hardware implementations of iWarp are starting to emerge , there is a need for software implementations to enable offload on servers as a transition mechanism , for protocol testing , and for future protocol research .
