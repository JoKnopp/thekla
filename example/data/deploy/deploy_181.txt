Sadly I lost a mighty RAT to a lowly 81X though I still have space in my grip. Getting Ani out saved character for me as Trent focused his 2 DSEs on Ani who survived. Trent stalled character by have the DSE intercept each others attack but one was discarded as I hoped. But I must thank San Hill as without him I would n't be able to deploy CFT to hope take out the 81X. I am wondering why Trent has n't been using Po Nudo to keep his DSEs alive though I do n't mind it at all. I think this turn could shape whether this will be a short game or a long one
