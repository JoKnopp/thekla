No , it was not premature. We hosted the defence ministers ' meeting on 21 February 2006 during which the ministers of the three framework nations asked me whether it would be possible for the HQ to deploy either in February or in August 2007. I clearly stated that if I received a decision in due time , the Corps would be ready to deploy in February 2007. The decision was made a little bit late but the HQ did a good planning work in May and June and now we can say that the training was conducted according to the plan and with good results. So the time is ripe for the mission. We are ready !
