Arturo 's research activities in the SEI also include some applications of his Doctoral Thesis Proposal. In this sense he is working with with Dr. Linda Levine from the SEI and with one of his advisers , Dr. Maribel Sanchez-Segura , in the development of an accessible and usable knowledge representation artifact based in product patterns in order to depict the required knowledge to deploy a software acquisition or development program avoiding the recurring patterns of counter-productive practices described by the acquisitions archetypes defined by the SEI ' s Acquisition Support Program. Besides , Arturo is working with Dr. David Zubrow and Mark Kasunic in the development of a tool for the deployment of the MAID method.
