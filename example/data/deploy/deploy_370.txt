By the way , our consulting arm has a similar mantra. We want to deploy packaged software for productivity and innovation that can be installed and fully deployed in three months or less , and will demonstrate a real benefit to our customers in three months or less after deployment. This means that those solutions have to be simple to deploy and easy to learn , but also solve an important problem for our customers .
