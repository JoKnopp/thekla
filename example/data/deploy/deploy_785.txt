No remembering long IP addresses or directly connecting to the remote PC - all you need to do is point your browser to the Remote Keylogger website to view logs of any machines you deploy Remote Keylogger on ! All logs are password protected and securely stored for your eyes only - and no worrying about waiting for the remote machine to sign-on to retrieve its IP address to monitor it .
