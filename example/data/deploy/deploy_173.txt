[ 0122 ] If the actual components are already deployed , but the actual components need to be reconfigured , the corresponding active object invokes specific actions to bring about the desired configuration changes in the component. Once a component is configured and deployed and its performance is satisfactory , the active object at the higher level in the dependency graph is notified. The next level object configures and deploys the actual component once all its supporting components are known to be ready and functional. This continues until all components , including the high-level service component are configured , deployed , and brought to the service delivery state .
