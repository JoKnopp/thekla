To deploy to National Instruments real-time systems such as the CompactRIO , the software requirements are to have LabVIEW , LabVIEW Real-Time , and LabVIEW Control Design and Simulation Module. To perform deployment , it is required that you create a LabVIEW project with the real-time hardware as the target. The control loop VI must be included underneath the hardware target in your LabVIEW project .
