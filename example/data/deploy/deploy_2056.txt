So how do you get results ? You start by making sure that work is structured so that it is a system one that gives knowledge workers visibility into the needs and expectations of your customers. Then you focus on developing the technical capability of the system and of the people developing your products. You structure your delivery system so that workflows are steady and predictable. Finally , you develop workers who accept the challenge to continuously improve their system so that it delivers increasingly better customer outcomes. Nothing is going to get you very far if you do not grow and protect the people who understand customers , decide what tests to run , write the code , keep up the cadence , deploy the software , provide support , and constantly improve the system so it delivers more value to customers .
