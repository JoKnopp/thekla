Quality Control is usually referred to simply as " testing " . Once you 've started a project to develop or deploy a software system , you need to find out whether it meets the requirements that it is intended to fulfill. One important way to do this is to develop a plan for taking the system through its paces the way the customer would , and execute that plan , looking for bugs in the software. Other testing activities occur before the system is completely finished - the sooner you find a problem , the easier it is to fix. A small part of the testing process is just common sense , but leveraging decades of experience accumulated in shelves full of books about testing , testers can be far more effective and efficient. This can have a dramatic impact on a product 's success .
