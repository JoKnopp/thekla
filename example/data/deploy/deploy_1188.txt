[ 0129 ] A new software service is a service that is not currently managed by an existing active object. Following this analysis , the active template representing the type of the new service to be created , first instantiates an active object in the active repository ( step 706 ) . This active object manages the new software service. The active repository deploys the software service in the network using the active object ( step 708 ) and the active object manages the software service ( step 710 ) with the operation ending thereafter. The actual deployment of the software service is performed using methods described in related applications. After the active object is created , the active object manages the software service as described with relation to FIG. 5 .
