There are 70 , 500 single parents on active duty in the U.S. military , but cases like Hutchinson ' s are rare. The Army requires all single-parent soldiers to submit a care plan for dependent children before they can deploy to a combat zone. Hutchinson had such a plan; her mother had agreed to care for the boy but became overwhelmed caring for three other relatives and decided she couldn ' t keep the baby for a full year. An Army spokesman said the Army would not deploy a single parent with no one to care for his or her child .
