Walking from machine to machine with an install CD is so 1998. As with many other routine activities , software installation can be largely automated these days. Systems management software is a type of software that bundles together several different utilities that can make an administrator ' s life easier. For example , it lets you specify standard , scripted answers to all of the questions that normally come up during the setup wizard. You generally roll up these preferences into an installer file ( also known as a software package ) and then deploy it to all of your computers. This is sometimes called an unattended installation because once you start the process , it finishes on its own without your intervention .
