On its return to the United States in 2006 , the Third Infantry Division completed its reorganization to the new modular system for infantry divisions and began to prepare for redeployment to Iraq for Operation Iraqi Freedom V. In January 2007 the 1st Brigade Combat Team deployed to Multinational Forces Iraq-West ( MNF-W ) in Anbar Province under the command of the 1st Marine Division. It was the first brigade in the Army to serve in Iraq three times. The Brigade 's area of operations was in central Anbar , primarily in and around Ramadi , the provincial capital. No other brigade in Iraq covered a larger area. The 1st BCT conducted nine brigade-level operations and transformed Ramadi from the second deadliest city in Iraq to its quietest in six weeks; the city had nearly 300 violence-free days during the Brigade 's deployment , due to its friendship with the area tribes in the Anbar Awakening , mentorship of the Ramadi municipal government and partnership with Iraqi police and army .
