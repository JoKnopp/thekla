i found out about this deployement this afternoon. . wish i would of known prior so that we could of attended this special event. my ex husband was part of this unit some years back. he never got to deploy with any of these SOLDIERS. he got to go on his own to IRAQ. afghanistan is afghanistan , but at least it is not iraq. not that it 's much safer there , but still ... ... ... ... i saw the pictures and it just brought me to tears. i recognized so many of these faces. i remember when i was an active member of the family support for this unit. i ca n't believe that for some this is their 2nd tour. the best thing that we can do is support the families of these SOLDIERS. MAY GOD BLESS THEM ALL and MAY THEY BE BACK HOME WITH THEIR FAMILIES SOON .
