This drill is designed to simulate a tactical need to deploy your knife while engaged in a ground struggle in which you are compromised from behind. You can keep the drill fresh and discover new ways to add stress by varying the types of push-ups you perform. Try fingertip push-ups to stress your digits more and provide you with extreme dexterity loss .
