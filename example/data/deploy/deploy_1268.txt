The new ESnet4 infrastructure will be provided by Internet2 through its recently announced agreement with Level 3 Communications to develop and deploy a new advanced nationwide hybrid network infrastructure with enhanced IP services as well as new dynamic optical capabilities that will serve the broad Internet2 member community. Through the agreement with Internet2 , Level 3 will provide the underlying bandwidth services over a dedicated optical platform with carrier-class reliability. Internet2 and ESnet will operate the ESNet4 optical infrastructure to provide flexibility and control in the dynamic provisioning of lightpaths and sub-channels needed to support today 's large-scale and highly complex scientific research. Level 3 will deploy Infinera 's Digital Optical Networking equipment across its infrastructure to enable Internet2 users to provision optical circuits dynamically. The new Internet2 network builds upon successful tests of dynamically provisioned optical waves for ESnet conducted earlier this year by the Hybrid Optical and Packet Infrastructure ( HOPI ) project of the Internet2 member community .
