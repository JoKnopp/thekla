[ 0050 ] FIG. 5C illustrates a flow diagram of an optimization process that can be performed according to yet another embodiment. At process block 510 , the plan script is optimized such that at least two deployment commands are executed simultaneously. The administrator can select to optimize the plan script such that the plan script can be executed as fast as possible. For example , a first deployment command to be executed on a first target computer device can be simultaneously with a second deployment command directed to a second target computer device. Thus , the optimization module 214 can be configured to determine which deployment commands are not interrelated and execute multiple target computing devices and/or infrastructure assets to be deployed with software components simultaneously. At process block 512 a plan script is executed to install the software components .
