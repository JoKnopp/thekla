you became a single mom after AIT i cant imagine why. Seeing as though youve been in 15 years that probably means you are upper enlisted or maybe an officer so for that i wont say want to call you. But you are a woman and you know how it can be ... ..single mom after AIT ... hmm we all have seen " THOSE GIRLS " . And if she didnt want to deploy so what I didnt hear yall protesting when she signed up .
