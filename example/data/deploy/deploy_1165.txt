In this scenario , you want to deploy an applet in user environments that run either the Windows or Mac OS. You want to use JNLP to deploy the applet in Windows environments that have plugin2 installed. In Windows environments that do not have plugin2 installed , you want to deploy the applet using the &lt; applet &gt; tag. You also want to use the &lt; applet &gt; tag to deploy the applet in Mac environments. Finally , you require the user 's environment to have JRE 5 or later installed to launch the applet .
