Staff Sgt. Jonathan Ariola , 624th Civil Engineer Squadron , hones his marksmenship skills prior to his deployment July 12 at the Combat Arms Training and Maintenance range Schofield Barracks , Hawaii. Sergeant Ariola is one of 54 Reservists from the 624th CES , which falls under the 624th Regional Support Group , who have been mobilized to deploy to Afghanistan for six months. This is a " partial " mobilization , meaning half the squadron is being mobilized as opposed to the entire squadron. Once in the AOR , the CE team will be supporting the Army at Bagram.
