Hutchinson had initially planned to have her 10-month-old son stay with her mother while she was away on the yearlong deployment. Now her mother says she is unable to care for the infant because she is caring for three other relatives with illnesses. The army initially gave her an extension to find someone to take care of her baby after her mother said she could not , but then reneged , saying she would have to deploy immediately. When she did not show up for her flight to Afghanistan , she was arrested and her son was placed in foster care .
