[ 0082 ] Service specification 510 identifies the functionalities provided by a service. The service functionality includes both the actual physical value delivered to the client and the manner in which the actual physical value is delivered. The functions provided by a service may depend on the manner in which the service is configured and deployed. For example , a stock-quote service may be deployed to provide real-time quotes or delayed quotes. Similarly , a document delivery service may be configured to deliver encrypted or unencrypted documents. In a service template object , all available functions are listed. A service instance object lists the specific functions selected and those that are currently enabled in that instance .
