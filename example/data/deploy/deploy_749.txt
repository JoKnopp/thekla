The Agent introduces the concept of Universal Release Management ( URM ) , allowing modifications to be built , tested , deployed , and installed anywhere in the enterprise at any time. Deployment of all managed files can be full or incremental; scheduled or immediate. Deployment definition screens allow the user to select the changes to be deployed as well as their targets and deployment scripts. The Agent manages change transfers and executes all deployment actions , and supports secure multiple deployments to multiple target locations .
