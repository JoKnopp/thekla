With the Afghan War heating up and the Iraq War still far from over , even if fighting there is at far lower levels than at its sectarian heights in 2006 and 2007 , with stress and strain on the military still on the rise , dissent and resistance are unlikely to abate. In addition to small numbers of outright public refusals to deploy or redeploy , troops are going absent without official leave ( AWOL ) between deployments , and actual desertions may once again be on the rise. Certainly , there 's one strong indication that despair is indeed growing : the unprecedented numbers of soldiers who are committing suicide; the Army 's official suicide count rose to 133 in 2008 , up from 115 in 2007 , itself a record since the Pentagon began keeping suicide statistics in 1980. At least 82 confirmed or suspected suicides have been reported thus far in 2009 , a pace that indicates another grim record will be set; and suicide , though seldom thought of in that context , is also a form of refusal , an extreme , individual way of saying no , or simply no more .
