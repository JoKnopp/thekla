No , I do n't think so. Browser-based applications fulfill a very specific need. I like to call this need " public applications " or " occasionally used applications. " A public application is used by an unknown public user. Many e-commerce apps fall under this category. Amazon.com creates their application ( site ) and waits for people to browse to it. There is no good way for the Amazon.com staff to deploy the app to their customers other than letting customers go to the Amazon.com site. Customers also want to start using the site immediately , and when they leave , they want no trace of the app on their system. Similarly , whenever I use my bill-paying application , I simply want to browse to a Web site and approve payments. I do not want to install software for this task , and I want to be able to do this from any computer I can get to .
