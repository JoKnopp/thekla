Roll-on/roll-off cargo ships are sometimes described as floating parking garages. They are the preferred type of ship for transporting most of an Army unit 's equipment , as the majority of Army vehicles can not be shipped in the standard containers that dominate the civilian shipping market. The capacity of roll-on/roll-off shipping is generally the main constraint in deploying Army forces -- the civilian shipping industry has relatively little roll-on/roll-off capacity compared with the Army 's needs , and the Army requires relatively little container capacity compared with the capacity of the civilian sector .
