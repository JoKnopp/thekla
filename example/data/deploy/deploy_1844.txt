Criticizing the decision , the CPB leaders said that the most important immediate task of the Caretaker Government ( CTG ) is to conduct an acceptable , meaningful , free and fair election. To implement this constitutional duty , it is absolutely essential for the CTG to reconstitute the Election Commission and to fully implement the Package Proposal ' of the CTG for election reform. But instead of implementing these urgent tasks , the decision to deploy the Army nationwide on the lame excuse that the situation requires " law and order , " will only make the country 's political scenario more difficult and deepen the existing crisis. The CPB leaders reiterated what is at present most relevant in terms of resolving the ongoing crisis : the full implementation of the CPB 's Package Proposal ' , and not the deployment of Army .
