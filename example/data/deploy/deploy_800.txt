( For example , if you can do 100 pushups but fail at 101 , your threshold is 100. So for this drill , you would perform sets of 50. ) Upon completion of the final rep , stay in the up position until your partner signals you to deploy your blade. Strive to keep your legs straight and support your body on the balls of your feet and one arm. Once you deploy your knife and your partner records the time , place the weapon on the ground and recover safely. Be sure to drill with your strong and weak sides. A good time to shoot for is 2 seconds .
