Deployment techniques were intended to support the installation of software in a once-and-for-all fashion. Things are changing because devices are increasingly connecting to each other , and deployment is becoming a kind of established service , in which software is released more often , maintained , customized , and even billed over the network. Deployment can be used as a marketing instrument , as a means to lower development costs , or as a way to add value and services to the software being deployed .
