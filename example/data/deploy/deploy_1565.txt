another thing that i know is that the msi package for adobe 6 does not work with windows 2000 when deployed from AD. its an issue with packaging. but i am sure that if you try to log on to an xp machine ... you package will be there as you wanted it. just something i realised with adobe msi on 2000 machines. you see it installing and all ... see it in add/remove programs ... but its not there for any of your pdf files .
