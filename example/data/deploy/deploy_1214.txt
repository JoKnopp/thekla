Last week , the German parliament ( Bundestag ) agreed to deploy up to eight Tornado jet fighters to Afghanistan. The planes will be used in a reconnaissance role in the south of the country currently the scene of violent struggles to support the operations of NATO troops under the command of the US. The deployment of the planes also means sending an additional 500 soldiers on top of the 3 , 000 German troops already stationed there. The mission is to begin in early April and will extend until mid-October .
