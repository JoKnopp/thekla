" With Specops Virtual Deploy , managing Microsoft App-V virtual applications will be just as managing any type of software , like a Windows Installer package , Patch or legacy setup but instead of deploying an actual setup , a virtual application , or bubble , is deployed , " said Thorbjorn Sjovold , Chief Technology Officer , Specops Software. " We are pleased that so many organizations will be able to take advantage of this due to the fact that no new investments in infrastructure and knowledge are needed. "
