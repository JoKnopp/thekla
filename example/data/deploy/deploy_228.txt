How much time is required to do the deployment ? The longer it takes to deploy a single artifact , the more important this criteria , and the more valuable the partial deployment approach becomes. Database changes are the best example : to drop and recreate every table in the database for a change would require a full backup and restore of the data , which will often take prohibitively longer than simply updating the few tables that actually changed. Online application updates are limited by network bandwidth , so they also benefit from a partial deployment .
