This explains how to deploy all software , particularly the 'free ' and/or unlicensed software such as PuTTY , WinSCP via the AD. Software deployed in this way , as opposed to installed manually on an AD machine , can be more easily updated when a new version is released and deployed. Firefox in particular does not play nicely with a mixture of local installation and deployment. The instructions are the same for all packages , but it is assumed that most initial use will be for the free software .
