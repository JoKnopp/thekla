You apparently failed to read that the miscreant involved made it clear to her comrades that she would NOT deploy under any circumstances , and would do anything possible to avoid deploying. Bringing the people back to formally testify at her trial would be more detrimental to their units , as a whole , then to simply muster her out. Which she seems quite happy with. Now , if she was the " wronged " one , would n't you think she would fight this ? Now , since you claim to have followed this retches tale of woe , where is it that you got sidetracked ? Was it at the point you read she is a woman with a child ? You seem to wanting to make a case for someone who tarnishes the shine that good female soldiers work hard to keep .
