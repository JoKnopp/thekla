CBO modeled sealift using data provided by the Navy 's Military Sealift Command ( MSC ) . ( 10 ) That modeling assumes that the majority of unit equipment will be transported by either fast sealift ships ( FSSs ) or large , medium-speed roll-on/roll-off ships ( LMSRs ) . FSSs are large , high-speed vessels with the capacity to transport containers and vehicles; LMSRs are large , medium-speed vessels with the capacity to carry vehicles. ( 11 ) MSC also maintains a fleet of slower , smaller roll-on/roll-off ships , but they take longer to activate ( most MSC ships are not kept in a fully active status during peacetime ) , carry less , and move more slowly than FSSs and LMSRs do. Thus , they contribute relatively little to MSC 's capability to deploy large numbers of vehicles -- which make up the bulk ( by weight ) of an Army unit 's equipment that would need to be deployed in any major military operation .
