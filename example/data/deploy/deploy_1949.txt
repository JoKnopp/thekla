Packages that are deployed for computers ( - &gt; CompConf\Software Settings\Software Installation ) are ready for all users who log on to the machine. The package gets installed when the machine reboots , before a user can log in. As soon as the installation is complete , users can use the software - without having to reboot the machine. Only Administrators can uninstall the package. Packages for computers can only be assigned. - Use this if you have applications that need to be installed , no matter who logs on to that machine. For example admin tools for the management machines or office applications for the financing machines .
