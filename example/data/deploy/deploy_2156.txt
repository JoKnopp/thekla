The service is shifting all its UAV dollars to Reapers. Compared to the Predator , the Reaper carries 600 percent more payload , and flies at twice the speed , Deptula says. The payload capacity is not just important to carry weapons but also to be able to deploy a new wide area airborne surveillance sensor pod. The WAAS will deliver with the same number of aircraft up to 60 times more video than the sensors currently on Predator. The WAAS has been dubbed Gorgon Stare , after the mythological creature whose gaze turns people to stone .
