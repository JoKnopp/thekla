When the software has been installed by IS Services , it will need to be tested thoroughly to ensure that all components are available and working as required and signed off by two nominated people. Staff nominated must make themselves available to test as IS Services will not deploy the software in the Computer rooms if it is not tested. Once all software is signed off to the satisfaction of those who requested it , the software application build will remain unchanged to preserve correct working of all the software installed on the build .
