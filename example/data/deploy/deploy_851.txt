from a servicemembers perspective who is familiar with situations such as these ... i dont think she properly utilized her family care plan ... because if you have a child with no one 2 care for them..then the army will not and can not deploy you. I dont know the specialist ' exact situation but it sounds like she had someone that was willing to take care of her kid and her unit was aware but she didnt want to deploy and used her kid as an excuse ... im guessing her chain of command was n't tryna hear it and said " if u miss movement we gon na nail your ass " and they did .
