March Forward ! sounds good to this Vietnam vet and war resister. Being an armed thug for the corporate elite and their middle managers in D. C. is no way to live a life or set a good example for our children and grandchildren. If people feel they must enlist in order to feed their families , or remain in the military because other options do n't seem immediately viable , and if they feel they ca n't refuse orders to deploy to Ir-Af-Pak , then let them find ways to resist from inside the causes of empire and death. I refused to carry a weapon halfway through my tour in Vietnam ( 1967-1968 ) . It was one of the best things I 've ever done. What a great day it would be if all the military men and women in all the world were to lay down their weapons !
