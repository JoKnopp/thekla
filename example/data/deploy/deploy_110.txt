Withdrawal and retreat of the English began early on the morning of 18th June. The English where 'about a league ' from the town of Patay , 20 miles North of Meung , when the French cavalry fell like a thunderclap upon the rearguard , which was commanded by John Fastolf. The English attempted to deploy for battle but on that open plain the French cavalry , led by La Hire and Xaintrailles , with Jeanne d'Arc , to her disgust , forced to watch their attack from a position in the rear , were among the archers of the rearguard before they could plant their stake in thick , defensive hedgerows , driving them back into the main body .
