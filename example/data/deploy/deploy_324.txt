Deploying early and often can also improve your architecture too , as deployment exposes issues about the system architecture that are easy to overlook in an development environment. How the application is designed affects how it can ( and should ) be packaged ( and the reverse is also true ) . While another groups may be responsible for the operational aspects of deployment , the engineering team is responsible for making the process work in a real environment. Consider configuration as just one example. Using a build tool like Maven or Ant , it 's a simple matter to keep a number of configuration files in synch by using filtering , and passing a property in to the build. Once you deploy a package that needs to be configured at a customer site , the fact that there are now many configuration files that need to be edited in the same way becomes an obvious source of wasted effort and possible error .
