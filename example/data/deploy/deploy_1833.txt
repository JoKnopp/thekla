To develop your ability to extract and deploy your knife with your weak side while you are being choked and restrained , begin by facing away from your partner. He then places you in a choke hold while immobilizing one of your arms. Your goal is to take out your ( taped ) weapon before he can maximize his hold and force you to submit. The drill continues until you extract your weapon or he makes you tap .
