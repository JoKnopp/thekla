The File Copy method consists of copying and pasting the deployment image either directly to a test station ' s local drive or to a network drive. Copying the deployment image to a local drive allows the test station to become self-sufficient and thus only reliant upon itself. However , the downside to using this option is the fact that distributing updates to all the separate test stations will be time consuming. Copying the deployment image to a network drive reduces distribution time and greatly assists in providing updates to the test software. Since this method is solely network based , common network problems such as network status ( up , down ) , speed of accessing network components , and accessing files already in use must be factored in. Another difficulty when deploying to a network drive would be determining if the test system fails because of an update of the files in the network or an actual test failure. When test software developers send updates to the network , normally notices do not get sent out. Thus it will be difficult to narrow down the test failure .
