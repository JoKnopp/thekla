The Seabees are the Construction Battalions ( CBs ) of the United States Navy. The Seabees have a history of building bases , bulldozing and paving thousands of miles of roadway and airstrips. They have been used on construction projects in a wide variety of military theatres dating back to World War II. The Seabee motto is We Build , We Fight . In World War II the Seabees land on islands in the Pacific shortly after the Marines. They served in Korea , in the Gulf War , and are serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. Seabees with the 25th Naval Construction Regiment will be deploying to Afghanistan. The regiment will be working with NATO and Afghan forces. As forces are beefed up in Afghanistan there will be a need for the Seabees. Seabees continue to provide critical construction skills in connection with the effort to rebuild the infrastructure of Afghanistan. This will be the 25th Naval Construction Regiment ' s first deployment to Afghanistan .
