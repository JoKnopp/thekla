" The improved security situation that our forces are generating has provided us with a real opportunity to increase the rate of our delivery of civil effect. I have therefore decided that when 3 Commando Brigade deploys to Afghanistan this October , it will deploy with an additional Infantry Battalion Headquarters and Sub-Unit. These forces will operate in southern Helmand to ensure that we are able to consolidate and exploit the security gains that we have made in that area. 3 Commando Brigade will also deploy with an extra troop of Royal Engineers to support our Provincial Reconstruction Team by undertaking Quick Impact Projects in support of the local community. These forces will be supported by more medical , logistical and equipment support troops .
