Morality is not question. And there is certainly no requiremnt to follow all orders. So this idea of following orders in violation of current military law , ( which of course torture and murder would qualify ) is nonsense. As to refusal to deploy , the only basis to refuse this order would be if the deployment itself was unlawful .
