The real power of JumpBox is that people without a lot of expertise in deploying server software can get complex applications running in minutes on any platform ( and can even transport them between operating systems , or drop them onto a public server -- the JumpBox company web site is actually running off a JumpBox appliance ) . For evaluation purposes , this is great because it means that you can quickly deploy and test software , and if it does n't suit your needs , you can throw it away without any time or money lost .
