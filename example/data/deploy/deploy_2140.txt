Once you decide to carry a knife for self-defense , you should choose a location and position for the weapon and stick with it. Then practice deploying it with your right and left hands. The terms strong side and weak side are used to distinguish the side of the body on which you carry it. If it is on your right , your right side will be your strong side; and your left side will be your weak side. The terms are not meant to reflect your relative level of expertise with your right and left hands. K.M .
