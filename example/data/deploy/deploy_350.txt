U. S. Marines are ready to get out of Iraq rapidly to enable a further 20 , 000 to deploy to Afghanistan as part of a major buildup there , Marine Corps Commandant James Conway said yesterday. As part of the drawdown in Iraq , where more than 20 , 000 Marines are currently stationed , Comm. Conway said he expected an equivalent increase of 20 , 000 or fewer Marines to Afghanistan , where about 2 , 200 Marines are deployed , to help fight against Taliban and al-Qaeda insurgents. This would help fulfill the up to 30 , 000 troops military planners have proposed to inject in Afghanistan in the next 12 to 18 months to bolster the 34 , 000 U. S. troops already there. Another 143 , 000 U. S. troops are in Iraq .
