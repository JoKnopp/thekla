Here 's a simple example to illustrate the kind of problem that can arise and how DFS can easily help resolve the situation. Say you have a midsize company of 250 users and you 've deployed Microsoft Office using the Software Installation feature of Group Policy. Typically this means you 've run Setup.exe for Office in administrative install mode using the /a switch , which unpacks the .cab files for Office into a shared folder you specify; for example , a share named OfficeInstallFiles on file server TEST220. Then you create a new Group Policy object ( GPO ) and configure a Software Installation policy that assigns the Windows Installer Package ( .msi file ) for Office to the computer accounts residing in some organizational unit ( see Figure 1 ) . The next time users whose computers reside in that OU restart their machine , Office will be installed on their computer automatically. As Gregor ( the character played by Stellan Skarsgard ) said in the movie Ronin with Robert De Niro , " So far , so good. "
