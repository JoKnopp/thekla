Once upon a time ( or should that be " Long , long ago in a ... " but I digress ) , I worked for a software startup company where time and man- ( people ) -power were limited. At one point or another , we all wore a variety of hats including tech support and ( gasp ) software testers. It 's an incredibly daunting and involved task and the company was always struggling to define just when they could/should release the next version of their product. They eventually went under ( not because the product was bad but because of more " administrative issues " ... but that 's another story ) and I was released from the responsibility of wearing many hats. Still , the fascination of designing , testing , and deploying software has never really left me .
