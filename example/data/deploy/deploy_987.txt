" She 's excited that she 's no longer facing jail and can still be with her son , which is the most important thing , " said Rai Sue Sussman , Hutchinson 's civilian attorney. " We 're very happy about it right now. " The decision still carries consequences for Hutchinson. She is being demoted in rank to private and will lose benefits afforded to military service members and veterans , Fort Stewart spokesman Kevin Larson said. Larson said the Army had evidence that Hutchinson , regardless of her family situation , would have resisted deploying " by any means. " He said commanders decided a court-martial would be too disruptive to the Army , requiring soldiers now in Afghanistan to return to the U.S. to testify .
