Novell ZENworks is a good choice for Novell networks. It uses NDS ( eDirectory ) to deploy software. ( You must install NDS on Windows NT/2000 servers to run ZENworks in a Windows environment. ) ZENworks is particularly good at customizing users ' desktops by creating and managing Windows 95/98/NT/2000 policies and user profiles. It will also scan the registry and system files to fix errors .
