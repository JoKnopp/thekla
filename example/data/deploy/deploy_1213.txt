We are very pleased that the IETF ( The Internet Engineering Task Force ) now has completed and published " NSEC3 " ( RFC 5155 ) . The NSEC3 Resource Record can be used as an alternative to NSEC , to mitigate zone enumeration issues. This is an improvement of the DNSSEC standards that many TLDs have been waiting for before deploying DNSSEC. This makes us even more confident that we now will have a broad cooperation among the internet community to realize DNSSEC for the entire Internet .
