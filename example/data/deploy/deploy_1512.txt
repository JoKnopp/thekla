WARREN : Yeah , the son , not the senior. And he certainly was in support of troops being disbursed. I think for the American people , there ' s too much detachment. I have a son who ' s a former Marine and I ' m former Army and I remember being at Camp Pendleton with my son and looking at these young men being deployed and my heart was really saddened that they were being sent into battle. But the reality , as the president said , is we either fight them there or we fight them here. Osama Bin Laden launched his attacks from Afghanistan. There ' s They have caught people here in recent time , intercepted them coming in from those havens. We are no longer standing back from Pakistan; we are going into Pakistan when necessary to pursue them. And so this is not one of those situations with rules of engagement that are going to limit us like we were in Vietnam or in some other areas , and I think that makes a big difference .
