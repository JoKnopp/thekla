But why would anyone want to deploy any of those server software programs on their local server in the first place ? JumpBox is targeting two core groups of users : those looking to quickly deploy complex software to test it out in a secure environment , and people who do n't want to jump through hoops to get their IT department to install something for them. JumpBox makes it easier for non-technical users to install server software on their local network. That software can then be shared over the network with their organization or used locally .
