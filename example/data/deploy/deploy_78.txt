As soon as The History Factory is retained , we assemble a project-specific research team and hit the ground running. In addition to our own full-time staff , we maintain close relationships with a broad network of archivists , librarians and researchers around the world to provide immediate access to industry libraries , the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office , the Library of Congress , the National Archives , the National Library of Medicine and other key information resources. We also deploy our research teams to anywhere in the world as needed .
