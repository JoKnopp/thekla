The current Full-Time Support ramp received approval before 9/11. Although this ramp up was a step in the right direction it proved only marginally acceptable while the Army National Guard served as a strategic reserve. Following 9/11 , the Army National Guard converted to an operational force mobilizing more than 240 , 000 Soldiers in support of the Global War on Terrorism. At the height of our mobilizations , the Army Guard deployed over 9 , 000 full-time support personnel. With fiscal resources only capable of backfilling the Active Guard Reserve at a 1 : 3 ratio and the Military Technicians at a 1 : 5 ratio , the burden on our Full-Time Soldiers reached an all time high. As a result , the Army National Guard witnessed an increase in the attrition of our full-time force by over 40 percent .
