CETIC ' s responsibility in the project is to quantify the benefits gained by the deployment of formal methods in industry. Such a measure is particularly critical , as it will be the main motivation for additional industrial players to deploy formal methods. To this end , CETIC first has to propose concrete measures that can provide such evidence , and then evaluate the improvement in practice of industrial partners when they deploy formal methods .
