b. Battalion. An OPFOR maneuver battalion reaches battle formation when its first-echelon companies deploy on line. Its second-echelon companies remain in march or prebattle formation until they are actually committed. Maneuver battalions are reinforced with several combat and combat support elements prior to contact with the BLUFOR. Reinforcement usually takes place in assembly areas or before reaching the start line for the march. These reinforcing assets deploy to become part of the supported maneuver battalion 's battle formation. ( See Figures 4-10 &amp;4-11 ) .
