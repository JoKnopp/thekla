And let 's not forget that DNS has two sides : the authoritative side , which provides the answers and the resolving side that asks the questions. So deploying DNSSEC not only means signing zones , it also means checking the signatures on a resolver. Deploying DNSSEC on a resolver is a lot easier than signing zones , so this is something that can already be done on a larger scale. Although the root zone is not signed yet , initiatives such as DLV by ISC and ITAR by IANA make it viable to deploy validating DNS resolvers .
