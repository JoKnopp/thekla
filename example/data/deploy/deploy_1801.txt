The Army has managed to keep up its pace of deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan in part by tapping brigades that have been newly created as part of a top-to-bottom reorganization of Army divisions. The 4th Brigade of the 1st Infantry Division , for example , is on the list of units scheduled to deploy to Iraq early next year. That brigade , based at Fort Riley , Kan. , was created in recent months and is now at the National Training Center at Fort Irwin , Calif. , for an intensive round of final preparations for the Iraq deployment .
