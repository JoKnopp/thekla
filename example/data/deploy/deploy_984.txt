The first approach is a full deployment : packaging together the entire application as a single unit. As a Java developer , this seems like a natural approach : the compiled Java class files along with other application files can be bundled into a single JAR , WAR or EAR file. A typical enterprise business application , however , consists of more than just the code. For the database in particular , deploying all the tables and views for the entire application when doing a release is not practical. Therefore , the second approach to defining a unit of deployment is a partial deployment : only include those application artifacts that have changed. The remainder of the artifacts are left unmodified in the environment being deployed to. For the database , this means that only those tables or views that have been modified need to be included in the deployment .
