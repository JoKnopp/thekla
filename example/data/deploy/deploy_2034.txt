In GPMC the deployments works slightly different than the Wizard in Specops Deploy Control Center. Instead of a Wizard , a deployment can be created from the Specops Deploy GPMC snap-in and is started from either the Computer or User part of the GPO. Select the root node named Specops Deploy under Software Settings and then click on the link Click here to deploy a package. This will show the new Deployment page that contains the same information as the Control Center Wizard .
