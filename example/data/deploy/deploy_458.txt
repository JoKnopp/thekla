[ 0004 ] Distributed environments such as clusters of computing systems , data centers , and grid systems involve managing a large number of resources and service components. Typical end-service provided to the users of such systems require composition of multiple resources and service components , which together deliver the end-service that is of interest to the users. Such composition of multiple components require careful configuration of the components and deployment of these components , such that they interface with each other in a compatible manner so that the composite service is deployed , initialized , handles the workload submitted by users , handles component level faults gracefully , and provides robust service while handling fluctuations in the workload .
