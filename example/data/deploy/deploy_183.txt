Due to prior working relationships with key MID Retail principals , Bachmann sent an RFP to the company , even though it was in its infancy. The MID allocation software was not used in a production environment at any retail sites at that time , but Bachmann made the risky decision to choose MID 's solution anyway. In February 2003 , the allocation project began. Within nine months , Big Lots was ready to pilot test the software. The team made a conscious effort not to deploy the software during the holidays. Therefore , Big Lots trained employees on the software and tested the effects of analytic algorithms on store planning/allocation , but did n't deploy it until after the holidays .
