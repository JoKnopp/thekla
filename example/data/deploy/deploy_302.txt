Any general order ( s ) that related to the M4 , its use , training , storage , etc ... CPD Response : Denied This request was submitted to determine if the Chicago Police Department had issued a new general order concerning the deployment , training , or purchase of the M4. The denial of the request confirms that a new specific general order was not authored to detail when the weapon can be used. This fact also lends credibility to the fact that the weapon is not being deployed solely to improve officers ' ability to respond to " low frequency events " . If the weapon were to be used only in the extremely rare " low frequency events " then CJP would have expected that a general order would have been issued detailing strict regulations governing when the weapon can be used.
