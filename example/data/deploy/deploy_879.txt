Now , assume for a moment that we can do that. How would that affect upgrading the packages deployed via that single GPO at a later time ? Say , going from Office 2003 SP2 ( I know , I know ) to Office 2003 SP3 and from MBSA 2.0.1 to 2.1 and from UPHCleaner 1.5 to 1.6 and so on and so on ... ..I would guess that there would be five entries in the right side of the screen ( in the GPMC SP1 ) and I would simply right click the package in question ?
