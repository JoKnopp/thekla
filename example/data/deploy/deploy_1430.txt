My fiance is currently deployed and I have other friends that also serve. I am familiar with these 'circumstances'. I can not tell you how many male soldiers both friends and aquaintences that I have spoke to about this topic that had really rather not serve with women and have less respect for them in the military because of the pitty that a lot of the women seek from their fellow male soldiers and the incompitence that they portray. And yes , there are a lot of female soldiers that use their children or pregnancies to avoid certian duty responsibilities .
