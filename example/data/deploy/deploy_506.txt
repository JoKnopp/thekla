I wrote a seperate batch file to stage patches ( non-MS ) to the remote servers. I deploy across the WAN another batch file via NSS that copies the patch from the closest server to a local folder on the PC then run the silent install for the patch from the local folder. Works great , once I figured out to deploy the batch file as an administrator with logon as service permissions .
