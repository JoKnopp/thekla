A real life example are debug builds of software. Visual C++ software that is compiled and linked with debug settings rely on system libraries that have debug symbols as well. Such libraries are usually installed along with Visual Studio. But if you deploy a debug build to a non-development machine , the software will complain that the wrong versions of required libraries are installed .
