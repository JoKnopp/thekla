The way we currently address this problem is using whole system imaging. That means that we load a machine with the OS , drivers , and all applications ( i.e. the whole system ) , and then we take a snapshot of the disk using a tool called Ghost. This image of the disk can then be deployed on similar hardware by writing the image onto the drive. Whole system imaging has a couple of problems : Different snapshots are needed for different hardware configurations and software distributions. In the best case , the image will work with a new hardware configuration , but additional attention is needed to install drivers and install/uninstall software packages. In the worst case , the new hardware is incompatible with the image , requiring building a new image from scratch .
