As today ' s engineers try to meet industry challenges , such as the need to bring products to market faster and integrate new technologies into existing systems , a modular test software architecture has emerged as an ideal solution. The modularization of a test system extends to software by emphasizing the development of test system software using reusable and easy to maintain modules. One of the tasks a test system developer will need to accomplish when creating a modular test system is to deploy this test software to the production floor. Whether you choose to build an installer , use a network server to distribute your test software , or leverage a source code control package , you will want to use care to ensure the integrity of the test stations while at the same time working quickly to have the upgrade process be as seamless as possible. Therefore , an appropriate software deployment strategy will be needed. Software deployment is the process of managing and automating the packaging , testing , distribution and installation of software files and/or applications to test systems across an enterprise network or production floor .
