Universal Deploy allows you to deploy new systems with different hardware. It usually takes you no time and effort to deploy a standard configuration image to identical hardware.

You should bear in mind that Microsoft SysPrep imports plug-and-play drivers , such as video , sound , and network drivers , but the drivers needed to boot the machine .
