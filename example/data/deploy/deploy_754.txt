Only by keeping the Army at the border will not work to regain our encroached upon lands. Nepal should also have deployed its Army during the time when India deployed its SSB forces along the border some four years ago. But the nonsense government ignored this. Indeed the theoretical slogan of Nepal Army is to protect its borders and preservation of national security but the fact is that our Police men are being mercilessly beaten by the SSB men by penetrating into our own lands and the government remains a mere onlooker to all these sad events. If the Nepali Police men are beaten and were not safe then let 's not talk of the harassment that the SSB men could have meted out to the general people. This is very much understandable .
