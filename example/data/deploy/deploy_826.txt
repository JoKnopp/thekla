( Miller 's History ) The southerners spotted by Jones ' picket post were veteran troops of Major General Henry Heth 's division , leading the march toward Gettysburg that morning. Well-liked by General Lee , ( Heth was the only Confederate officer Lee addressed by his first name ) , the plucky general was uncertain of what lay ahead of him , be it Pennsylvania militia or troops from the Army of the Potomac , so he ordered his lead unit to deploy in a skirmish line and drive away the blue-clad troopers. The job was given to the 5th Alabama Infantry Battalion , which advanced in good order and quickly encountered groups of cavalrymen who fired on them from the protection of fences and trees. Three miles away at Gettysburg , General Buford calmly awaited the report knowing full well that a thin line of cavalrymen were no match against solid ranks of infantry. Though Reynolds ' corps had started toward town that morning , Buford had to wonder if they would arrive in time before he was forced to retreat .
