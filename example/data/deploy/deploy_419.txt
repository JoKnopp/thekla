The total number of personnel and brigades that the Army could keep deployed indefinitely reflects certain assumptions about how the Army would manage long deployments. In particular , this set of measures assumes that the Army would use rotational deployments of units ( in other words , that the Army would deploy entire units for a certain period , at which point a new unit would be deployed to replace the first unit ) . The Army has used rotational deployments for all of its peacekeeping and occupation missions in the recent past , although it does use other forms of deployment for some of its commitments. ( 16 )
