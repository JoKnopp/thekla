The whole operation is managed from a custom Windows console with images either deployed manually - by selecting targets from a list - or automatically , with distribution kicked off when a pre-set number of targets have been discovered. Images can be password protected for security while templates allow for customisation of settings such as the Windows workgroup or domain , Security Identifier ( SID ) and so on. You can even deploy to different hardware from that used to create the image , by adding the optional Universal Deploy module ( Â£ 4.99 + VAT per PC ) .
