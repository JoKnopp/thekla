Manually gathering all files needed for distribution is a tedious job , but provides the developer full user control over what files are deployed to the target computer. One of the most common problems developers experience when deploying test software is missing or incorrect versions of file dependencies. A file dependency is a secondary file that a file requires to compile , load , or run correctly. Normally dependencies come in the form of DLLs , .NET assemblies or subVIs. It is extremely important that you identify exactly what dependencies your test software requires , as well as their versions. This can be challenging and in many cases one might need a third-party product to determine the explicit dependencies of a file .
