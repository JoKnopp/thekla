The Army has yet to outfit its first two LAV-III brigades at Fort Lewis , but has just announced a plan to transform four more brigades : a light infantry brigade in Hawaii , a light infantry brigade in Alaska , the HMMWV brigade in Louisiana , and a National Guard brigade in Pennsylvania. This announcement has caused even more confusion. Why spend a billion dollars to transform a National Guard brigade for rapid deployment ? Can these reservists achieve such a high level of readiness that they can deploy into combat with 96 hours , the Army 's stated goal ? ( Of course not; this is a political game to garner support from certain congressmen. ) Second , Hawaii is a terrible location to base an LAV brigade because vehicle maneuver areas on Oahu are non-existent , and the only large caliber firing range has been closed because of a legal dispute. Third , despite the myth that the Army plans to " lighten up " , the three active light brigades will add LAVs and heavy-up to become medium-weight brigades .
