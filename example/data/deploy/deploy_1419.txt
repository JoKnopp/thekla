I am proud that ASB and several other schools in this global community have deployed DyKnow software for classroom management , increased material coverage , more active learning in the classroom , even online study groups and distance learning. And of course the IT folks are drawn to the software because of its central server design , discreet bandwidth use , and integration options to SIS and other existing databases .
