This software permits the user to record all keystrokes that are pressed on the target computer. It runs in stealth mode , so it is invisible to the user of the computer. Once the customized keylogger file has been generated , it only takes a couple clicks to deploy it on the target machine. The logs can be sent to a mail address , or they can be read locally using the specialized viewer or a web browser. Logs are in HTML for readability .
