Finally , Figure C-1 illustrates the effect of prepositioning sets of equipment on ships. Such sets do not increase MSC 's total transport capability over long periods of time , but they accelerate the point at which the first deliveries of unit equipment arrive in a theater. The long time gap before any transport ships arrive is one of the primary disadvantages of sealift. Prepositioning sets of equipment on ships narrows the gap greatly , reducing that disadvantage of sealift. In fact , because such prepositioned sets are normally configured for heavy forces , and because large light forces are generally deployed by sea , in some cases prepositioned heavy units could arrive in a theater before light units did .
