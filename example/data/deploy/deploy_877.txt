I have to tell you sometimes it is n't always the woman 's fault. My daughter heard over the summer that they would be deploying in Jan. Then her commander told her that was an untrue rumor , that they were not going to deploy. As a result she and her husband decided to try for their final child. She is due to leave for Afghanistan in early Feb. Hopefully she is not pregnant ( waiting test results ) or she is afraid they will think she did it on purpose. My daughter does n't want to leave her two sons , and husband , but she is otherwise looking forward to her deployment .
