I immediately notice that all of the units deploying in spring 2009 are National Guard units. Is this because they 're attempting to give those units more lead time , and they just have n't announced the active duty units that will also deploy next spring ? Or are only National Guard units deploying at the beginning of 2009 because the active force is tapped out ? I 'm going to assume it 's the former. If it 's the latter , God help us .
