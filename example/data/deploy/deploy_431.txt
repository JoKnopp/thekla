This all happens very quickly. In fact , one of the leading advocates of continuous deployment , Eric Ries , talks about how his company would deploy commercial software to the customer base multiple times per day. He stated that if each engineer did n't deploy at least every few days , it meant that something was wrong. You can make the same continuous development &amp;deployment principle work for you when redesigning business processes. Adopt the philosophy that every day during the design cycle , something , anything , must be " shipped. " It could be a new form for ordering , a prototype of an online database for tracking customer data , or a change to your CRM tool. The key is that you release constantly and learn from what happens. Think small frequent changes , not big delayed changes .
