To calculate the ROI of a particular migration , you need a few cost numbers. Whenever possible , use historical budgetary data for the best accuracy. Not everyone pays the same for software , so if you use the actual value your organization pays , your calculation will be more credible. You need to find out two figures : the cost of the status quo replacement system and the cost of deploying your free software alternative. Calculate the cost of the status quo system as everything your organization will pay if you don ' t go with free software. The cost of the free software deployment should not be $ 0. It ' s neither believable nor true. Be sure to include support contracts from a third party and outsourcing costs for deployment or staff training , even if you pay nothing for the actual software .
