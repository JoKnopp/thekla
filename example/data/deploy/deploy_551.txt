Support : The second reason that encryption software has not been deployed is that it requires too much support from the IT group. Traditional products require key servers , PKI , directories , redundancy , integration work , and additional IT and Help Desk staffing. Not to mention the stack of legal documents that accompany a PKI. Vigilant is the first true desktop product that does not need a full infrastructure or significant numbers of new IT staff to support it. Vigilant can be installed without a PKI infrastructure yet will support one when your company is ready for it .
