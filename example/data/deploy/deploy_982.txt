This drill prepares you for the eventuality that your blade might partially open or fail to open at all. First , visualize what you would do if that happened in combat. When your partner gives you the signal , extract your weapon and deploy it as described in the timed deployment drillbut this time you will not be timed. Continue to kinetically deploy the blade until you experience a failure , then execute your preconceived striking or distraction technique. Immediately try to open the blade again. Your goal is to improve your ability to immediately recognize the problem and work through it .
