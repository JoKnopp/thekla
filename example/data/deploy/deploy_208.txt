Finally , the modifications tab ( shown below ) allows you to further customize a package for users with special needs. For example if you wanted to deploy a language-specific dictionary for users in different offices , you could apply a modification to the package. Modifications are made in the form of .mst files ( also known as transform files ) . For those who are interested , there is a utility provided with the Office 2000 resource kit to create .mst files.
