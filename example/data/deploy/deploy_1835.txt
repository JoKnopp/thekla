Problem : The Deployment Counter on the Package Object is not increasing even though my clients were successful in installing the deployed package. Resolution : If Domain Computers does not have WRITE privileges to the Package Object , this counter will always be zero. It is entirely up to you if you want to allow Domain Computers to be able to write in the properties of the defined Package Object , since this is only a counter , and does not indicate which machines actually have the AXIOLK-1.0.0-BETA1.MSI installed .
