When implementing CM processes , build , package , and deploy can be a good place to start. It is usually one of the more visible areas where a CM ' er can show value. It is not important to debate the name of the processes involved in this part of the lifecycle. If there are names that the project teams understands which represent the building , packaging , and deploying of deliverables ( a.k.a. , release package ) into ' production ' , consider using them. The easier recognition may improve adoption. If there is no set process , consider documenting the current process and sharing it with the team. Once a process is defined , it also becomes a good basis for suggesting improvements. Ultimately , a CM ' er must show ( added ) value and these processes are a good place to start .
