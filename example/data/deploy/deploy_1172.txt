When deciding on a suitable backup knife to carry , you should think about how well youll be able to conceal it , access it and deploy it. For example , if youre considering a neck knife , will it be carried on a nylon paracord or does it come with a breakaway ball chain ? What will you do if the chain breaks but the knife stays in its sheath ? Have you trained to prevent the para-cord from being used against you as a garrote ? Try to make your backup weapon as accessible as possible without helping the bad guy get his hands on it. K.M .
