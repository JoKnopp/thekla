Both implementations have the same functionality , with the exception that when the Software Update Wizard runs as a Service it runs in the SYSTEM security context , and therefore has rights equivalent to Administrator rights to update any files on the host computer , even files which the logged on user does not have rights to change. For 'modern ' operating systems like XP , Vista or Windows 7 the service implementation should be the preferred option as it allows you to securely deploy the full range of Software Update Wizard features for a negligible memory overhead and virtually zero cpu utilization ( except during the actual update process itself ) .
