After we created our share , we ' ll need to put the file into it. You can deploy the following files to users and computers via Software Installation : MSI , MST , MSP and ZAP. MSI stands for Microsoft Installer and is a installation package that contains both the installation files and an installer which can be either configured by the enduser ( or the administrator , if you wish an unattended installation ) . MST files are Microsoft Transform files , that bring modifications to the MSI installer files , like different destination paths of installation , installer settings ( feature pre-select ) and installer execution settings. MSP are patch files , that update installations of software packages. ZAP files are Zero Administration Packages that do not bring the functionality MSI packages will ( like patching , uninstallations ) . ZAP files are basically text files that provide information on how to and from where to install applications. I ' m somewhat lucky as my gpmc comes as a Windows Installer file ( MSI ) .
