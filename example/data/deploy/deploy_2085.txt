Wow. Lots of good points here. I do have to share that one of my closest friend 's husbands is in the Navy. He was deployed last week for the 3rd time. And while it is very sad to have him go - it is a conscious choice that he made. He was given warning of his deployment and time off with his family before hand. The experience has been as positive as it can be , considering we are in wartime now. I have nothing but admiration for the incredible sacrifices made by the military .
