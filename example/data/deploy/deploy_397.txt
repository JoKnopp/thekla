Throughout the lifetime of the project , DEPLOY methods and tools will be intensively deployed in real industrial settings by the industrial partners in order to test them against the industrial imperatives of cost-effectiveness , scaling and ability to cope with evolution of requirements. The industrial deployment will be in five sectors , each of which is key to the future of European industry and society : automotive , rail transportation , space systems , telecommunications and business information. Each deployment sector will be led by a partner who is a major player in that sector .
