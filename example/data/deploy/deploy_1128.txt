UPEI ' s research strategy pursues the following broad goals : the support of research , individually and in teams , across the full spectrum of academic disciplines; the enhancement of teaching and learning by an environment rich in research and creativity; the development of a dynamic culture of research , creativity , and innovation across the University. As the province ' s only university , UPEI must be a key site for and play a leadership role in knowledge-based development. To help achieve these goals , UPEI will seek to deploy Canada Research Chairs and Canada Foundation for Innovation grants to promote the development of teams of researchers comprising scholars from more than one academic unit or discipline. These teams will be encouraged in areas of existing or emerging research strength and excellence. Supported areas of research will have a demonstrable impact in terms of benefits and reputation for Prince Edward Island , the Atlantic Region , and Canada. Canada Research Chairs will be catalysts and leaders for these constellations of researchers and Canada Foundation for Innovation grants will help provide the tools needed for high-level collaborative research .
