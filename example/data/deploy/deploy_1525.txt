For independent software vendors ( ISVs ) and their customers , there is more to a solution than just the application. A complete solution includes an application , but it 's an application that is integrated with the middleware components that enable the application to work in the customer 's environment. To turn their applications into solutions , it is common for an ISV to have to navigate through the complex process of obtaining , installing , configuring , and supporting many different middleware components from multiple suppliers with different terms and conditions , different licensing structures , and so on. From there , the process of integrating an application with all the different supporting components -- and deploying them all together for the customer -- is often equally complex .
