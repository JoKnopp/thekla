The Agent supports process enforcement and regulatory compliance with audit trails and separation of duties , via role-based security. The Agent takes full advantage of the power of TRUEchange , providing the technology to roll out and to roll back deployments with full auditability. With its powerful automation capabilities the Agent allows a user to do such things as deploy a software package to a production system; deploy a package and execute an installation script on multiple target machines; copy out files and execute a build script on remote build machines; push files to other platforms without having to log into those machines .
