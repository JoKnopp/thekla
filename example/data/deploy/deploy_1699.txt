Hutchinson , who was scheduled to deploy Nov. 5 from Hunter Army Airfield , said the situation was not so simple. She said that she had been willing to deploy but that the only relative she had to take care of her son her mother , Angelique Hughes backed out a few days before the departure date. When another option fell through , Hutchinson said she was told the only option left was foster care. She no longer is in contact with the child 's father .
