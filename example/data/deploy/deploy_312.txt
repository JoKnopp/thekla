To meet these requirements , the user 's environment needs to have JRE 6 Update 10 or higher installed , including the version of the Java Plug-In software for JRE 6 Update 10 or higher. That level of the Java Plug-In software allows you to deploy an applet to earlier versions of the JRE such as JRE 5. In addition , the user 's environment needs JRE 5 or a JRE 5 update release installed. Applets that run with a version of the Java Plug-In software prior to JRE 6 Update 10 can only run in the corresponding version of the JRE. For example , the Java Plug-In software packaged in JDK 6 Update 7 allows you to run an applet only in JRE 6 Update 7. Because of this restriction , you want to upgrade user environments to the latest JRE 6 version if they have a JRE installed that is in the JRE 6 family , but that is at an update level lower than Update 10 .
