Damn , no Orn Oh well , at least I 've 2 Rats in space to assist with deploying ground units which I think I 'll need. Those 2 Droid missiles and 81Xs are a threat to my Rats , so I 'll deploy my RAS to divert attention I 'll task all of my ground units to take out those pesky 81Xs. Padme H is alone in character I have Rapid Recovery but It 'll only serve to keep her alive as the DSE with its 40 speed and Stun 3 would diminish her next attack it seems I 'll have to use DIIC to stall character though I 'll keep San Hill alive as he benefits my build gain .
