When you initially install the Security Update Inventory Tool or the Microsoft Office Inventory Tool for Updates on the site server , the installer program can automatically create the necessary collections , packages , programs , and advertisements you must have to deploy the tool component to SMS client computers in your enterprise. These default objects are designed to assist you in deploying the software update inventory tools in your enterprise and to work together with the other software update management components , such as the Distribute Software Updates Wizard. However , in some cases these default objects are not sufficient to meet the needs of you enterprise. In this case , it is recommended that you allow the installer program to create the default objects for you automatically , and then create your own collections and create or modify the other objects you must have when you finish testing the tools. For a list of the considerations you should take into account when creating or modifying these objects , see the " Software Update Management Best Practices " section later in this chapter .
