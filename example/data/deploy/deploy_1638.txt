Native Windows Installer packages detect the native package files that they update. For example , suppose you have deployed Microsoft Office 2000. When you deploy the next version of the program , the new package file will automatically mark your original Office 2000 deployment for upgrading. If version 1.0 of a program is not a native Windows Installer program , you will have to manually specify the package that the new package upgrades .
