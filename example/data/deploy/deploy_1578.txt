" It is in this context that I have , with the military advice of the Chiefs of Staff , decided to make a number of adjustments to the profile of our forces in Afghanistan. Currently we have 7 , 800 troops in Afghanistan deployed to Helmand , Kandahar and Kabul. As a result of a recent review I have approved the removal of around 400 posts from the Afghan Operational Establishment Table. These posts are no longer required due to reorganisation and the changed nature of the tactical situation. At the same time we have identified a requirement for , in total , 630 new posts , creating a net increase in our forces in Afghanistan of some 230 personnel to around 8 , 030 by Spring 2009 .
