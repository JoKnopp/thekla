CRT stands for Change Request Team and is a concept originally introduced by Ralph Kasuba , our VP of Engineering ( aka chief squire ) way back in mid-2005 ( trust me , 1.5 years is way back for us ) . The CRT process was an alternate process created to streamline deployment of smaller changes to our production environment in a timeline of weeks rather than months. Prior to these CRT releases , we found ourselves continually frustrated because even the smallest most trivial changes to the system ( content changes , a new setting here or there , etc. ) would sometimes have to wait 2-3 months to deploy out to our production environment since they first had to be synchronized with all of the other large code changes going on in the system for the next release. This was akin to the trap Microsoft frequently found itself in when many of their products had to wait for the new version of Windows to ship .
