Agosto is publicly refusing orders to deploy to Afghanistan. Having served in the Army since 2005 , including a tour in Iraq , Agosto can no longer bear to serve and says that he is , ready for the consequences , whatever they are. Since May 11th , he has been refusing all orders directly connected to his unit 's deployment to Afghanistan , including an order to track the serial numbers of trucks headed for Afghanistan. He has since been assigned to non-deployment tasks such as sweeping the motor pool and " company area beautification " as he waits to see what the military will do to him .
