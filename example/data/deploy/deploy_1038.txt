It is also possible to deploy software through Microsoft Active Directory Group Policy Objects. In this approach , 'setup packages ' are linked to Active Directory Organizational Units , possibly filtered further by membership of security groups. The setup packages will then be executed ( or not ) based on the fact that the computer and/or the user reside in the given Organizational Unit. Obviously , this offers a very flexible way of managing software deployment , provided the Active Directory is well organized : if all users are thrown together in 'Users ' and all computers in 'Computers ' , there 's hardly a way to diversify .
