Similarly , you can expand LabVIEW Control Design and Simulation Module usability with other NI software tools. For example , you can use the LabVIEW System Identification Toolkit to find empirical models from real plant stimulus-response information and the LabVIEW Statechart Module for event-based control design or event-driven simulation. You can deploy dynamic systems to real-time hardware targets with the LabVIEW Real-Time Module for rapid control prototyping and hardware-in-the-loop applications .
