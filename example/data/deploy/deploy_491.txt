All of our components and plug-ins have been designed as single-file .NET assemblies to help you quickly finish your deployment projects. Since our components have no outside dependencies , you can deploy your application simply by copying your application executable and GeoFrameworks assemblies ( also known as " XCopy deployment " ) . Registry keys used by GeoFrameworks components are created automatically if they are not found , and resources for other languages are packaged within the assembly .
