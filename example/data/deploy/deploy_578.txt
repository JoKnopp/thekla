Aside from the unrealistic assumptions about rapid air transport , this plan raises many more questions. If these new light armor brigades will be first to fight , what is planned for the 82nd and 101st Divisions , the Army current rapid deployment units ? If these two airmobile divisions need light armor firepower , why not convert some of their brigades ? What ' s the plan for the Army ' s armor brigade pre-positioned overseas on ships ? It requires far less airlift to fly soldiers overseas to link up with their heavy tanks and 30 days of supplies. Will they wait for weeks while entire light units deploy by air ? The Marines have a division of material pre-positioned on ships overseas; will they wait too ? Will scarce airlift be devoted to flying water , ammo , fuel , food , and light armor overseas while dozens of ships loaded for heavy combat wait in nearby ports for their soldiers and marines to arrive by air ?
