Note that you can deploy your .NET solution that uses the Security Manager using ClickOnce. You do n't need to do anything special , just deploy your solution. There 's a problem however : if two solutions install the Security Manager in this way , then uninstalling one of them will break the other one. To bypass this problem use RegFree COM which is available for Windows XP and higher; look at the sample that deploys Redemption in this way .
