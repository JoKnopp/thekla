SAN FRANCISCO , April 15 , 2009 -Robin Liffmann sets her alarm for 4 : 45 a.m. every morning. By six , she ' s in the gym. She ' s not training for a 26-mile marathon , but one of another kind. Behind all her motivation is a decision Liffmann made many months ago to deploy to Afghanistan with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in support of the Overseas Contingency Operations. I ' ve always enjoyed working out. I just upped it a notch , said Liffmann , an environmental manager with the Corps ' San Francisco District. I want to make sure I ' m physically fit. I don ' t want that ever to be a drawback.
