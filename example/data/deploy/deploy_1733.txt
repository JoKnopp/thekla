A sentence from the back cover caught my attention : " If you 're a developer and do n't want to be on call at 3 a.m. for the rest of your life , this book will help " . Up until a few months ago , I worked with a group of software engineers who designed and deployed software apps for an enterprise ( read " multinational " ) environment and they all took turns on call. Not that they did n't do good work ( they did and do very good work ) but I started wondering if they might want to add Deploy It ! to their library .
