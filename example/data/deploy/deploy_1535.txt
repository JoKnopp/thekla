Ellis looked at upgrading to a more powerful version of WinInstall , which he said was quite expensive and in tests failed to deliver what he wanted. " We found that reporting on the machines that did not complete set tasks was very poor. If we tried to upgrade 30 computers , it might tell us five had failed , but it did n't say what they failed on. And it would n't tell us which applications had deployed successfully and which hadn't. "
