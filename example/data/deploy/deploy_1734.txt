It is recommended and best practice to put the files into a DFS share to make sure the files will be still available if one file server fails. You can get into trouble if you share the deployment files on a single fileserver and the server comes down or needs to be replaced by a newer machine. You would then have to re-assign all software packages. So try to use DFS to deploy your software packages .
