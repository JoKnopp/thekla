[ 0041 ] As new services are composed and instantiated on top of existing services and/or physical resources , new active objects are instantiated in active objects 406. Similarly , when a composite service is no longer needed , both the composite service and the active object used to manage that composite service are both terminated. The terminated active object is garbage collected. In addition , the active objects within active objects 406 corresponding to the component services or resources used to support and compose the service being terminated are all updated to reflect the fact that they are no longer supporting the composite service. When a component service is no longer needed , the corresponding active object within active objects 406 is destroyed and garbage collected , unless the policies dictate otherwise. For example , a policy may dictate that at least one service instance be deployed at all times regardless of the current demand on that service. In such a case all instances of that service , except the last one , are terminated when there is no demand for that service .
