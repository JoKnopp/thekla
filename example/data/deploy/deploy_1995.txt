I 'm sorry , these soldiers are going to Afghanistan. I could understand if you called the Iraq War into question , but not the action in Afghanistan. Either way , quit putting your stupid political ramblings on this blog and put the focus where it belongs ... the heroic men and women deploying to Afghanistan. As a base employee , it was awesome to see all of the support outside the gate on my way to work this morning .
