Bishop went absent without leave ( AWOL ) for one week the day his unit deployed , " because I did n't have time to prepare to file for CO status. So while AWOL I prepared a statement and filled out my application for CO ( status ) . Then I went back ( to Fort Hood ) with Branum and turned myself in. I never planned on staying AWOL. They gave me a barracks room and assigned me to a platoon and told me to show up to work the next day. That was it. They started the CO process , but they also started the Uniform Code of Military Justice process , and that 's where it gets shifty. "
