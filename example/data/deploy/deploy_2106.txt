Colonel Joseph Horam says antidepressants have made " a striking difference " in the way troops are treated in war. A doctor in the Wyoming Army National Guard , Horam served in Saudi Arabia during the first Gulf War and has been deployed to Iraq twice during this war. " In the Persian Gulf War , we did n't have these medications , so our basic philosophy was 'three hots and a cot ' " giving stressed troops a little rest and relaxation to see if they improved. " If they did n't get better right away , they 'd need to head to the rear and probably out of theater. " But in his most recent stint in Baghdad in 2006 , he treated a soldier who guarded Iraqi detainees. " He was distraught while he was having high-level interactions with detainees , having emotional confrontations with them and carrying weapons , " Horam says. " But he was part of a highly trained team , and we did n't want to lose him. So we put him on an SSRI , and within a week , he was a new person , and we got him back to full duty. "
