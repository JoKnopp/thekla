" Most sizable IT organisations have to manage hundreds , if not thousands , of software licences for their IT teams , " said Michael Swindell , senior vice president , marketing and products , Embarcadero Technologies. " Many report that it can cost more to manage these tools than to buy them in the first place. The ToolCloud enables organisations to centrally manage their Embarcadero tools and simplify deployment. With ToolCloud and InstantOn , technologists get on-demand access to the many tools they need to solve critical tasks , while reducing the costs associated with deploying and managing these tools. "
