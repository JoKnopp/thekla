Ms. SUSSMAN : She informed Specialist Hutchinson , who informed her command , and she was given an extension to try to find someone else. However , shortly before she deployed , she was told that she would not get that extension after all , and that she would need to find someone to care for her child within 24 hours , and she needed to be on the plane. Because she was scared and did n't want to abandon her child , even if she knew it was wrong to disobey orders , she felt that she could not get on that plane. However , within a day , Specialist Hutchinson returned to Army control with her child , and that is when the Army arrested her , put her in jail , and took her infant away from her .
