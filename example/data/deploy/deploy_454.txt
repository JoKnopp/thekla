" Some call Znamya 2 a sail because it was made of a large , lightweight reflector and unfurled like a solar sail might be unfurled , " says Les Johnson of the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center , co-author of the soon-to-be-published book Solar Sails : A Novel Approach to Interplanetary Travel. " In fact , if I were asked to demonstrate solar sail technology and was constrained to deploy it from a large spacecraft , I might design a 'sail ' like Znamya. "
