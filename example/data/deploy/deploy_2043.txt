When using Group Policy to deploy software in your Active Directory domain , you basically need to edit an existing Group Policy Object ( GPO ) , or create a new GPO. The GPO needs to be linked to a site , domain , or organizational unit ( OU ) . A GPO that is linked to one these components has a Software Installation node located under the Computer Configuration node , and a software installation node located under the User Configuration node. You can access a GPO linked to a site , domain , or OU , through the Group Policy Editor console. The Software Installation node in the Group Policy Object Editor console can be considered the main tool used to deploy software. The Software Installation node also enables the centralized management of the initial deployment of software and the removal of software. You can also centrally manage software upgrades , hotfixes , and patches from this location .
