After receiving his orders to deploy to Afghanistan , Bishop needed time to prepare his application for CO status , so he went AWOL for a week because I didn ' t have time to prepare to file for CO status. So , while AWOL , I prepared a statement and filled out my application for CO [ status ] . Then I went back [ to Fort Hood ] with Branum and turned myself in. I never planned on staying AWOL. They gave me a barracks room and assigned me to a platoon and told me to show up to work the next day. That was it. They started the CO process , but they also started the Uniform Code of Military Justice process , and that ' s where it gets shifty.
