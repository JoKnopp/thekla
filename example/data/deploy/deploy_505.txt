They were all very dedicated , caring soldiers and they will not be forgotten , and we 're carrying on in their honor. " Major Nidal Hasan , the shooter in the fateful rampage , was also supposed to deploy with the unit today in interviews , Hasan goes unmentioned and the soldiers in the unit steadfastly refuse to speak of him .
