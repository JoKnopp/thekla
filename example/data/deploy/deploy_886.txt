Wireless devices support different operating systems and different hardware capabilities. Factors such as the version of the operating system , the hardware supported , such as memory size , and firmware capabilities determine whether a given version of the software/content can be deployed on a mobile device. An example of information maintained by the server to determine if the selected software/content can be deployed on a particular device is shown in FIG. 3. The mapping contains two catalogs. Software/content catalog 105 provides storage for the various software/content items that may be deployed onto mobile wireless devices , as well as information relating to the requirements needed to install the software/content items on particular mobile devices. For each software/content item 302A-N listed on server 101 , information identifying the software/content item 304 , information specifying the requirements 306 to deploy the software/content item , and the code/content of the software/content item are stored. Requirement information 306 typically includes an encoding that specifies information such as the required operating system , firmware version and the hardware requirements for the software/content item .
