Use the A/B testing concept for your business process changes. Instead of deploying a changed form , website , or process to the entire set of " users , " deploy to a smaller set of test users and compare the differences. Did the new process perform the way you expected ? If so , deploy the change to the rest of the process users. If not , go back , re-develop that part of the process and re-deploy. Continuous development and A/B testing are a tightly linked loop of design , development , deployment , testing , and re-development. Just remember that A/B testing without continuous deployment means that mistakes will be out in the wild much longer than they should and continuous deployment without A/B testing means that issues may go unnoticed for far too long .
