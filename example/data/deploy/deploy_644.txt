My preference is for full deployments. Unless circumstances require a partial deployment , I feel that the default choice should be to deploy everything. Unfortunately , this is seldom possible in a complex enterprise environment. Many enterprise applications consist of a collection of components or services such as web application , database , batch processing , scheduling , reporting , and web services. Due to organizational or logistical reasons , it is seldom possible to do a full deployment of all of these components in a single release. At the application level , therefore , a partial deployment is often done. It is at the component level where it is easier to achieve full deployments of the individual components .
