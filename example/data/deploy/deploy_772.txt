The US Army political machine is fighting to retain ten active duty divisions. The key factor is that American strategic lift can only deploy five army divisions within 120 days. Since reserve divisions can be mobilized and ready for war within 120 days , what is the point spending billions of dollars each year to keep extra divisions on active duty ? The other challenge for Army Generals is getting " their share " of each year 's defense budget when the Army has a surplus of the most modern equipment in the world. The Army 's solution is to form " light armor " brigades , which require less strategic lift and thousands of new vehicles. While the media is fascinated by Army Chief of Staff General Eric Shinseki ' s beret blunders , they ignore his scam to waste $ 7 billion dollars to buy thousands of wheeled Light Armored Vehicles ( LAVs ) .
