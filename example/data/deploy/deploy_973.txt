How is it that Jeremy is refuting the article without proof ? Fact of the matter is that she was required to have a childcare plan , was ordered to deploy , and thumbed her nose at the military. She did not show up to deploy. That carries stiff penalties within the military. And do n't think that the military would refuse to help her. They know full well how deployment can affect families and provide support services to them. That is a fact as I have used them myself. If you take the time to read other articles out there , it is stated that she was given many other alternatives for childcare and denied them all .
