[ 0033 ] In one embodiment , the plan execution engine 204 can be configured with logic to read a plan script and interpret the plan script to execute deployment commands stored therein. Upon reading the plan script , the plan execution engine 204 can communicate with one or more target computing devices to deploy one or more software components. The plan execution engine 204 can deploy software components to target computing devices and/or infrastructure resources using various methods. In one example , the plan execution engine 204 can invoke a function to be executed at the target computing device. In another example , the plan execution engine 204 can execute an installation function , such as an applier , to deploy software components. In yet another example , the plan execution engine 204 can send a message with the necessary data to be deployed to the target computing device. For instance , if the target computer device is to be activated , the target computing device can receive an activation message from the plan execution engine 204 .
