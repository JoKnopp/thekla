The goal , of course , is to lower TCO. An IDC study , " Quantifying the Business Benefits of Directory-Based Desktop Management " , surveyed companies that deployed Novell 's ZENworks. The Novell-sponsored study concludes that the average three-year return on investment ( ROI ) was 2 , 039 percent with payback in less than three months. While such staggering ROI results may not be realistic for all companies , deployment tools can help reduce or redirect IT staff , and make hardware and software use more efficient. Microsoft 's deployment support relies on scripted routines for the Windows installer to access installation files on a network share point , and packaging techniques like Windows 2000 's Remote Installation Services ( RIS ) . The types of installations this technology can support are somewhat limited. RIS was designed to work hand-in-hand with Windows 2000 IntelliMirror software , which provides user data management , software installation ( including third-party software ) , software maintenance , and user settings management. RIS requires DNS , DHCP , and Active Directory to find clients and provide settings and installation instructions , which limits its use to installations with Windows 2000 , ME , and XP clients , and Windows 2000 serversa &gt; . For older versions of Windows and non-Windows clients , you will need a third-party deployment product .
