WARREN : No , because what happens , the more we deploy , the greater the unemployment is in that area , the fewer soldiers there are that are spending money. Even though families , many families , leave here. They go back home to their parents or wherever they come from in terms of comfort level during the periods of deployment , so it has a depressing impact in terms of the economy. The buildup that you ' re talking about in terms of supplies and the logistics of it , we don ' t do that much of that business here so that we would benefit in the same way that Bush looked out for , you know , his fellow Texans when they started giving out contracts to contractors for Iraq .
