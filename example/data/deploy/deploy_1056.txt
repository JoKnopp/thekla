Second , Figure C-1 shows why using sealift can greatly reduce the differences between the times needed to deploy various kinds of units. In essence , the reason is that ships travel at the same speed regardless of what type of unit equipment they carry. In this scenario , between day 25 and day 30 , more than 400 , 000 tons of equipment would arrive in the theater by ship ( excluding prepositioned equipment ) . That arrival time would be roughly the same ( with some small difference because of loading time ) regardless of whether the ships were carrying the equipment of a light unit or a heavy unit. About 400 , 000 tons would be enough to encompass either a light division or a heavy division , which means that there would be no meaningful difference between the times required to deploy the two types of divisions by sea.
