" Mary how are you hearing you 're getting ready to move from being a a wife. -- to being in a wife with an absent husband. -- and I mean it 's not an entirely new feeling we spent her engagement with and deployed to Iraq and have been a part the last six months it 's it 's kind of neat because we got married young so it 's given me an opportunity to think about living on my own without experience would be like. But not having sort of of all the other -- still having a partner even if he is -- those little bit about the change here because. Your first deployment is its own animal right I mean you do n't really know what to expect you not really sure what the problems are gon na be. Or how hard it 's going to be while while he 's away now you 're going into another deployment where you know what it 's -- like is that -- make it easier or harder. You know it 's weirdly harder and say I think it's. "
