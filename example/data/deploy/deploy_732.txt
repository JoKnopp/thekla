[ 0051 ] Implementations of the various techniques described herein may be implemented in digital electronic circuitry , or in computer hardware , firmware , software , or in combinations of them. Implementations may be implemented as a computer program product , i.e. , a computer program tangibly embodied in an information carrier , e.g. , in a machine-readable storage device or in a propagated signal , for execution by , or to control the operation of , data processing apparatus , e.g. , a programmable processor , a computer , or multiple computers. A computer program , such as the computer program ( s ) described above , can be written in any form of programming language , including compiled or interpreted languages , and can be deployed in any form , including as a stand-alone program or as a module , component , subroutine , or other unit suitable for use in a computing environment. A computer program can be deployed to be executed on one computer or on multiple computers at one site or distributed across multiple sites and interconnected by a communication network .
