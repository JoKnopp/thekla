As you deploy new software versions on the server , the client will download and install the new version in the background , completely transparent to the user ( and with a good amount of control by the developer ) . You 've no doubt already heard of similar technology today through BITS ( Background Intelligent Transfer Service ) , which is the auto-update mechanism that Microsoft Windows uses. In fact , developers can use BITS for their own purposes .
