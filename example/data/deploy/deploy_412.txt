As if software license compliance wasn ' t difficult enough , now administrators must contend with a new wrinkle : virtualization. Andi Mann , research director at Enterprise Management Associates ( www.enterprisemanagement.com ) , says virtualization rewrites the whole licensing methodology : Licensing paradigms are more complex , there is more software to worry about , it is easier to deploy unlicensed software , and it ' s much harder to detect what has been deployed. Also , he adds , deployments can happen in the blink of an eye and can move around and disappear very quickly .
