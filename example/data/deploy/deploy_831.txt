Spc. Alexis Hutchinson , an Army cook stationed in Georgia , was arrested last November after she failed to show up for her deployment flight to the Middle East. The 21-year-old single mom said she could n't find appropriate childcare for her infant son. Hutchinson 's mother in California was initially supposed to take care of the child while Hutchinson was deployed , but two weeks after agreeing to watch him , her mother sent the little boy back , saying she was overwhelmed because she was taking care of other family members with special needs .
