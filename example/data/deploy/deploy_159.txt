[ 0036 ] Note that a request may be processed by multiple software services before completion and all such services need to be made available by configuring , deploying , and managing at runtime. A software service may be supported by the system , but the software service may not be configured and deployed at all times. Even if the software service is configured and deployed , the software service may not be configured to fulfill the requirements of the service request in terms of desired performance and/or the manner in which the service is to be delivered; e.g. , a request may ask for a service to be delivered in secure or in dedicated service delivery mode .
