In this scenario , you want to use JNLP to deploy an applet and take advantage of the new JNLP features introduced in JRE 6 Update 18. To do that , the user 's environment needs to have JRE 6 Update 18 , or later , installed , as well as plugin2 , the next-generation Java Plug-In software. You also want to upgrade user environments to JRE 6 Update 18 or later if they only have an earlier version of the JRE installed. Your applet can then deploy in those upgraded environments. Some user environments might not be upgradable to JRE 6 Update 18. For those environments , you want to deploy an applet , although one that ca n't take advantage of the new JNLP features .
