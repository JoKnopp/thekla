If version 1.0 has not yet been installed , the next time that the user logs on and clicks the advertised shortcuts , an installation of version 2.0 will start. The user can install version 1.0 or 2.0 from Add/Remove Programs. Document invocation will only install version 2.0 if the GPO that is deploying version 2.0 has a higher order of precedence than version 1.0 .
