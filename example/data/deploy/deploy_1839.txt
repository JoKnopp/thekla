There is a right way and a wrong way to deploy SIP and unfortunately , most of the time , consumers are unclear about the choices they have or what to do and are unfamiliar with technologies that are available to them. Here is what to keep in mind. Each SIP conversation requires about 84Kb ( Kilobit ) in data to function correctly ( without compression ) . Compression can sometimes be used or turned on to reduce the voice/data utilization and optimize networks , but the more you compress the sound , the worse it sounds. Different vendors have developed different compression techniques to get the most out of your bandwidth. One thing for sure , IN VoIP , YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR ! ! ! ! Different providers might give you different SLAs ( Service Level Agreements ) . Be sure to read them and understand your terms and conditions .
