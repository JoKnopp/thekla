[ 0004 ] In one aspect , a method to deploy complex software to a target computer infrastructure is disclosed. The deployment of complex software includes permitting an administrator to provide a description file that describes the desired state of the target computer infrastructure. The description file can be parsed at a deployment control center. In addition , the live state of the target computer infrastructure can also be determined at the deployment control center. A comparison of the live state and the desired state of each infrastructure resource can be performed to determine state deltas. Based on such comparison , it is determined whether the infrastructure resource requires the deployment of a new software component. A plan script can be generated in order to deploy software components to the infrastructure resources requiring deployment of the new software components. In a further aspect , the plan script can be optimized for fast deployment of component modules , efficiency , testability , and the like .
