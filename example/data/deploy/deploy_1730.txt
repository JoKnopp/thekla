Realtime-Spy is undetectable to all users. Using minimal PC processing cycles , Realtime-Spy is not visible in any way to the user , and records and stores all logs without any user notification. Realtime-Spy cloaks itself to hide from the remote user , so the original file you deploy can be deleted - yet the PC still stays monitored ! Realtime-Spy is also invisible in the Windows Task Manager .
