Today , the Third Infantry Division is preparing for new missions and upcoming deployments. Since October 1 , 2007 the 1st Brigade Combat Team has trained as part of CCMRF , the U.S. Northern Command 's Chemical , Biological , Radiological , Nuclear , and high-yield Explosive Consequence Management Response Force. If such an incident were to occur in the US , it would deploy as the Department of Defense 's initial response force to support civil authorities in saving lives , preventing further injury , and providing temporary critical life support. After March 2009 the 4th Brigade Combat Team will begin to transition from a heavy bridge combat team with armor and mechanized infantry units to a lighter infantry brigade combat team. In the process it will lose the 4th Battalion , 64th Armor and gain the 3d Battalion , 15th Infantry. The 3ID is also preparing for the addition of a 5th Brigade Combat Team at Fort Stewart. In the fall 2009 3ID Headquarters , 2nd Brigade Combat Team and 3rd Brigade Combat Team will deploy to Iraq for their fourth tour in that country while other units may deploy to Afghanistan .
