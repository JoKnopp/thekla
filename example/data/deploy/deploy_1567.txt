Computerworld - In my career , I have managed the deployment of Macintosh labs and offices in colleges and elementary schools and at companies with a few workstations and at major corporations. In handling most large-scale deployments or software upgrades , the most efficient solution is to use imaging , which places the contents of a master disk image on the hard drive of each workstation or computer. Creating and deploying a master image -- whether you 're installing new computers , restoring computers to a default state or providing a massive system upgrade -- can be a major task for any IT department .
