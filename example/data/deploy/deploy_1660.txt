If applications do not appear as expected , this is probably the result of a problem in how those applications were deployed. To determine whether an application has been assigned or published to a user , log on as that user , and then start Add/Remove Programs. If the application appears in Add/Remove Programs but there is no Start menu shortcut , the application has been published rather than assigned. If the application does not appear in Add/Remove Programs , the application was never deployed , or it was deployed in the wrong organizational unit , or the user is a member of a security group that is blocking the application of this GPO .
