The 75th Ranger Regiment was among the first combat units to deploy inside Afghanistan with a low-level combat parachute assault conducted on Objective Rhino. The parachute assault was the first combat airborne operation by United States forces since the 75th Ranger Regiment conducted a parachute assault into Panama in 1989. Additionally , Rangers of the 75th Ranger Regiment conducted two additional low level parachute assaults into the western part of Afghanistan during the early phase of the war to seize key terrain and provide support to ongoing combat operations. To date , the 75th Ranger Regiment is the only light Infantry unit to be continuously engaged in combat operations in Afghanistan since October 19 , 2001 , and the only unit required to maintain a significant portion of its combat power in theater conducting 24-hour combat operations .
