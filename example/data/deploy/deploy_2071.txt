Meanwhile , the Army has no plans for its four heavy armor brigades in expensive Germany , who have no role at all. When the Army attempted to move one of them to Kosovo , it discovered that there was no overland route through the Alps because several bridges were too weak for 70-ton tanks and several rail tunnels too small , so it took weeks to shuttle them by river barge. As a result , the 3rd Mech Division in Georgia can deploy tanks by ship anywhere in the Mediterranean faster than the brigades trapped in Germany. Since the Army already spends billions of dollars each year to keep brigades in peaceful Germany , does n't it make sense to organize one for rapid deployment by air ? Shinseki failed to address this issue , but claims his LAV plan will improve forces in the Pacific , but he will move no units .
