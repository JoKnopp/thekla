Enterprise software deployment is the most traditional method of deploying recruiting or staffing software throughout an organization. Enterprise ( sometimes called self-hosting ) deployment means that you buy the software as a licensed product and purchase and own all of the hardware , servers , power systems , backup systems , communications , and other infrastructure at your location. You are completely responsible for hiring and supporting IT staff to handle the ongoing maintenance of your hardware , software , and infrastructure. In addition , you ' ll pay for software maintenance and support from your vendor , which typically runs about 20 of the software license cost , each year .
