The maintenance team for a typical enterprise business application must make ongoing changes to the application. In the effort to fix defects , revise existing functionality , and add enhancements , little thought may be given to the process by which these changes are deployed from development through to testing and then the production environment. However , this process is equally important : no matter how carefully the changes are made and tested in development , they must also be implemented properly in production or a failure will occur .
