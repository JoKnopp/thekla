Let ' s go ! First thing to do , we create a share on our server , where the installation files ( - our MSI file ) will reside on. It can be a standard share - since I ' m on a test server , I ' ll put it to C : \AppDeploy. The permissions on the share should be set to Everyone : Read , NTFS settings should be set to Everyone : Read &amp;Execute . Share and NTFS permissions are a common point of failure when deploying software to workstations and users .
