I guess a combination of things. I concluded some time while I was in Iraq that these wars were wrong , but I wasn ' t ready to make that jump because I feared the consequences. But after a while I got to meet a lot of people in the peace community who would be supportive of me if I were to take such an action. That , combined with the fact that I just wasn ' t sure if I could live with myself if I were to deploy , if I actually got on a plane and went over there. It made it almost a no-brainer for me and something I needed to do .
