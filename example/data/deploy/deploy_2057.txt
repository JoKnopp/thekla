We also use the IntelliJ Java development environment , a commercially available tool that has won industry accolades as one of the best and most productive java development environments available. For many internal data development tasks , we use Microsoft Excel , Access , Visual Basic , and SQL Server. These tools allow us to build and deploy software systems for internal use very quickly , where time-to-completion is more important than scalability. For these tasks our non-open source tools provide significant benefit over the open source tools that are currently available. As new tools and technologies become available , we periodically re-evaluate our choices , and change when better alternatives become available. If you are an MPC member and would like to make use of these services , please contact Bill Block for more information .
