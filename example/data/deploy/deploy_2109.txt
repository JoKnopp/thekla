One of my favourite phrases is " the perfect is the enemy of the good , " and nowhere is this more true in the design of business processes. In the past , businesses undergoing process redesign , whether they called it TQM , BPR , or Six Sigma , all made a similar mistake. They took far too long to develop the process , hoping for a " perfect " final design that met all objectives and avoided all constraints. As someone who has fallen prey to this seductive path myself , I can tell you with 100 certainty that there is no " perfect process " waiting around the corner , there is no " magic bullet , " there is no single " correct solution. " The process that is actually deployed and is actually in use is almost always better than that " perfect " process that exists only on a Visio diagram hanging on the wall. Business needs and goals change so quickly these days that you simply can not afford to spend months designing the ultimate business process. By taking an extended period of time to develop our business processes , we risk a final product that was " perfect " for the situation that existed several months ago , but useless in today 's environment .
