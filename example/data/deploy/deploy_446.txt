What folks on the ground want is motion video , says Deptula. The plan is to deploy four WAAS pods on Predators in April 2010. That is going to allow a single aircraft to stare not just at one spot but 12 separate spots. A more sophisticated version scheduled for 2011 will deliver 30 video images simultaneously. An even more advanced model that could be available in 2012 will provide 65 images .
