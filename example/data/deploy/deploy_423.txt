The Formotus solution uses hosted services to deploy mobile phone software over-the-air. Customers sign in to their Management Console on the Formotus site to deploy applications to their mobile users. The client software on the phone connects to the Management Console on the Web for authentication and to receive notification of new or updated applications. The phone client pulls and installs the deployed applications , which connect directly to the customer 's backend business data .
