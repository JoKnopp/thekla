The training priority for the Army National Guard is preparation of combat-ready Soldiers so that lengthy post-mobilization training can be avoided. As a result of the increased emphasis on ensuring our Soldiers are combat ready , the Army National Guard Duty Military Occupational Specialty Qualification rate for fiscal year 2005 was 92.29 percent ( excluding those Soldiers on their Initial Entry Training ) . This high qualification rate was achieved through the implementation of the phased mobilization process. This allowed Army National Guard Soldiers who lacked the requisite training to complete their individual training while in the early stages of mobilization before they were deployed .
