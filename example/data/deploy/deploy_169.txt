Julian , Thanks for your feedback. I think there are many reasons that teams do n't realize the relationship between deployment and the architecture. A big one is that many " release engineering " tasks are thought of as a separate discipline from designing and building software. Even one believes that different people should be doing the deployment work ( I do n't; the agile idea of generalizing specialists makes a lot of sense to me ! ) working on deployment early will expose the problems so that we can fix them. We 'll get there. Agile methods have raised awareness of the value of everyone testing early. Everyone deploying should follow soon .
