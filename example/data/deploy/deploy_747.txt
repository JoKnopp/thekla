I think a key factor in this situation is that this soldier was told by a supervisor that if she showed up for her deployment with the child , the child would be taken away , put in foster care , and she would have to deploy anyway. If this is n't true then someone gave her misleading information which does n't justify her actions but is more understandable why she did what she did .
