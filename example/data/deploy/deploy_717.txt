If you want to break things down to a more granular level , you 'll discover a number of detailed features that make browser-based applications such a great choice. Single server ( farm ) deployment is a great way to deploy an application to a large number of people because you really do n't have to " deploy " to those people at all. Instead , people " pull " the application 's interface down on their browsers. You do n't really deploy or install the application on the client machines. Naturally , this provides a great upgrade path since only the server needs to be updated. The standardization of the browser-world is a blessing , and you can often compensate for the remaining differences by technologies such as ASP.NET. Certainly some HTML-based applications are more sophisticated than others , but by and large , users have fairly up-to-date browsers that allow for sophisticated functionality .
