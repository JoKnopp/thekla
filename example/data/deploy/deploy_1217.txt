Two years ago , General Shinseki presented a plan to form several medium-weight brigades to be airlifted overseas and into combat within 96 hours; " fort to foxhole " was the sales pitch , along with a " goal " of landing an entire medium division within 5 days. Realistically , it would prove difficult to round up and move a light armor brigade to a nearby Air Force base within 4 days , without advance warning. In addition , the Air Force could only have two dozen transports ready on the flight line within 4 days , only a tenth of what a medium weight brigade requires. The Army claims that an LAV brigade can deploy in 217 C-17 transport sorties , but ignores the fact that only 120 C-17s are in service worldwide , and most of them are needed to support Air Force and Marine Corps deployments. Finally , the big problem of logistical support by airlift is evaded by planning for units to deploy with only three days of supplies .
