Systems and methods of deploying one or more software components to a target computer infrastructure are disclosed. A descriptor file that declares a desired state of one or more target computing devices of a target computer infrastructure is parsed. A live state of the one or more target computing devices is obtained. A set of target computing devices having the live state different from the desired state is identified. A plan script that includes deployment commands configured to deploy one or more software components to each computing device is generated. The plan script can be optimized such that when executed the software components are deployed with higher efficiency , system stability , minimum downtime , etc .
