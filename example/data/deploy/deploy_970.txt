Many report that it can cost more to manage these tools than to buy them in the first place. The ToolCloud enables organizations to centrally manage their Embarcadero tools and simplify deployment. With the ToolCloud and InstantOn , technologists get on-demand access to the many tools they need to solve critical tasks , while reducing the costs associated with deploying and managing these tools.
