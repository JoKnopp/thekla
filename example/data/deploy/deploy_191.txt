Master Sgt. Robert Tancayo , 624th Civil Engineer Squadron , inspects weapon cases prior to distributing them to deploying members at Honolulu International Airport Friday July 31. Fifty-four Reservists from the 624th Civil Engineer Squadron , which falls under the 624th Regional Support Group , have been mobilized to deploy to Afghanistan for six months. This is a " partial " mobilization , meaning half the squadron is being mobilized as opposed to the entire squadron. Once in the AOR , the CE team will be supporting the Army at Bagram.
