[ 0087 ] The second part of dependency requirements 512 describes the requirements imposed on the services that depend on this service. This part is meaningful only for services that are not deployed as high-level services. A high-level service is one that does not support any other service in the system , but may process end-user requests. Some of these requirements are static ( e.g. , dependent on the software version ) , some are semi-static ( e.g. , dependent on the service functions enabled ) , and still some others may be dynamic ( e.g. , depending on the quality of service delivered by its supporting services , a service may adjust the requirements the service imposes on the services that the service supports ) . In an active object , the dependency requirements are exposed only for the functions enabled in service specification interface 510 .
