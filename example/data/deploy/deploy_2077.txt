[ 0047 ] In FIG. 4B , the BCR tests 404 may include a subset of the ACR tests 402. In the example of FIG. 4B , a software solution product certified under the ACR tests 402 would necessarily pass the BCR tests 404. According to an example embodiment , the ACR tests 402 may be more specific than the BCR tests 404. For example , an ACR test 402 may test whether the software solution automatically starts or is initiated after deployment on an operating environment. Then , for example , a BCR test 404 may test whether the software solution either automatically starts after deployment on an operating environment or gives a user an option as to whether the user wishes the software solution to deploy .
