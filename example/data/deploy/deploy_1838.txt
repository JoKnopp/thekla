While Rodes dealt with Baxter and Paul on Oak Ridge , Brig. George Doles ' brigade of Georgia troops sparred with Schurz 's Eleventh Corps positioned in the fields north of Gettysburg. Though he was outnumbered , Doles ' superb generalship kept the Yankee troops , who appeared shaky from the beginning , off guard. Poor morale , exhaustion , and the exposed position of the Eleventh Corps troops , many who were German and Polish immigrants , contributed to the disaster about to befall them. Another division of Ewell 's infantry under Brig. General Jubal Early , arrived via the Harrisburg Road at approximately 3 P.M. Understanding the advantage of his position , Early deployed his troops and artillery so that he could sweep behind the Union line .
