Staff Sergeant Ronn Cantu , an infantryman who was deployed to Iraq from March 2004 to February 2005 , and again from December 2006 to January 2008 , said of some of the patrols he observed while there : " [ They ] would n't go up and down the streets like they were supposed to. They would just go to a friendly compound with the Iraqi police or the Kurdish Peshmerga [ militia ] and stay at their compound and drink tea until it was time to go back to the base. "
