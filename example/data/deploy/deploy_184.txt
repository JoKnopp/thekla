I would like to place on record my appreciation of the support that the Squadron has received from employers. As they deploy this week our thoughts and prayers are with the troops and their families and we wish them a successful tour , and I know they will live up to the Squadron motto Cum Patrea Mea Vocat  When my Country Calls  .
