" Mr Speaker my announcement today of a net uplift of 230 additional troops does not in proportionate terms represent a very significant increase. It does not mean our mission is expanding. It means we are taking the steps necessary to take our mission forward as effectively as we can , with a force whose profile and capabilities are optimised to the conditions that they face. As I have explained the uplift and rebalancing will enable our forces to strengthen their protection and to increase the rate at which they are able to build Afghan capacity , in security , governance and development. Some of these new capabilities will need a year before they are available for operations in Afghanistan. Others will deploy much sooner. And , of course , we shall continue to work to develop the optimum balance of forces and capabilities  " in conjunction with the Afghan Government and our Allies  " in what can be rapidly changing conditions. These additional forces will ensure we can maintain the growing reach of the Afghan Government in Helmand , increase the military contribution to development and accelerate the pace of Afghanisation .
