Your trial period for Cosmo2 is over , and you have decided to upgrade to the new package. You have been told that for the best results , you should remove Cosmo2 , which is a limited trial version , before deploying the full version. You also will be phasing out the Green application , so you want users to be able to continue using Green , but do not want users to be able to install it. You want to remove the software without visiting each computer. You can use Group Policy settings to perform this function for you .
