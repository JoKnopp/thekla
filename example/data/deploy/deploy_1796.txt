Although 51Sqn will deploy with approximately 150 personnel its relatively few numbers belie its capabilities , which in effect allow the RAF Regiment Squadron to punch above its weight compared to an army infantry company of similar size. Squadron Leader Brown explained : We have our own organic Weapons Support Flight providing 81mm mortar indirect fire support. We also have our own organic sniper section able to provide covert surveillance and interdiction of insurgent activity and then we have three Rifle Flights , which have their own direct fire support in the guise of the heavy machine gun , all of which means that we are considerably better equipped and more capable than our army counterparts of similar sized organisation.
