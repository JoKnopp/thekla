[ 0112 ] When a request for service can not be served using an existing service or service composite , the active template representing the type of service requested is notified. In turn , that template evaluates the request and either instantiates a new active object to manage a new instance of that service or instructs an existing active object to reconfigure the managed object to accommodate the new request. The instructions for reconfiguration are performed simply by changing the desired state of the managed service. The actions followed in such a case are a subset of the actions followed when a new active object is created. In the following , the set of actions performed by a newly instantiated active object are described. These set of actions lead to composing and deploying a composite service from component services by recursively traversing down the dependency tree and then building up the component service tree until the entire composite service is fully configured and deployed .
