Add in Remote Installation Services and some configuration management effort up front , and we routinely deploy systems with a clean OS install and current software installations in a matter of hours , regardless of office location. That may seem long compared to disk-imaging techniques , but we have the equivalent of dozens of up-to-date configurations always available , even when one of our hundreds of deployed software packages are upgraded. The extra hour or two per machine is worth it , in our opinion , particularly because most of that time is unattended operation .
