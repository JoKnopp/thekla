In this analysis , the level of reserve mobilization needed to support an extended deployment assumes that the Army would commit the maximum level of forces that could be sustained. If the Army committed less than that , the necessary level of reserve mobilization would be lower. In general , the Army prefers to use active units before mobilizing and employing reserve units. As such , if the Army had a relatively small set of commitments , the fraction of a deployed force that would be composed of reserve units would be lower than for a deployed force that required the Army 's full ability to sustain extended deployments .
