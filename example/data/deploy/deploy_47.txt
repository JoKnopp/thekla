[ 0086 ] The first part of dependency requirements 512 describes the dependency requirements for making the service available. In a service template object , dependencies are listed for each function the service is capable of delivering. In a service instance object , dependencies are listed only for the functions enabled in that instance. In addition to the resource dependencies ( e.g. , requires a server with at least two CPUs and Red Hat.RTM. Linux.RTM. Enterprise AS Release 3 OS ) , the dependency information also includes both the spatial ( e.g. , a service may depend on a database and a file system and these need to be available on the same subnet where the service is deployed ) and temporal dependencies ( e.g. , a backup service may depend on access to high bandwidth network from 2 AM to 3 AM on each Friday ) .
