[ 0038 ] Administrators may interact with the system for performing actions , such as setting policies , configuring or reconfiguring resource states , for configuring and deploying software services by overriding default settings , etc. using administrator interface 308. Commands issued by administrators are sent via administrator interface 308 to service infrastructure manager interface 306. At the backend , service infrastructure manager interface 306 interacts with orchestration and management services 310 and active repository 312. Active repository 312 consists of active objects and active templates. The active objects interact with end-point resources 314 or with the software services that run on top of the end-point resources via end-point management interface 316. In addition , orchestration and management services 310 also interact with active repository 312. As mentioned earlier , requests are actually processed at end-point resources 314 .
