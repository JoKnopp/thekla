Hutchinson enlisted in the Army in 2007 straight out of Fremont High School in East Oakland. She was supposed to deploy overseas as a cook with her unit , the 3rd Infantry Division , on Nov. 5. She skipped the flight , she contended , because she had nobody to take care of her then-10-month-old son , Kamani .
