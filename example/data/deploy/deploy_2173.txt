Do n't know the 'rotation ' training for the Guard these days as most have deployed once or twice. Back in 03 my kid 's unit was on active duty status , then sent for 2 months 'fort ' training and came home. The kid then went to another unit to start training them. Then the whole 'bunch ' , including reservists , spent several months at a 'fort ' to train before deployment. As an IRR he got the 'letter ' , 3 mos local active status , 2 mos 'fort ' and deployed. The across the street son-in-law reservist has a different story .
