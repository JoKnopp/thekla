The large number of units in each army means that we recommend the game be played on at least an 8 ' by 4 ' table. This will ensure that each unit can deploy as per the scenario map and will still have enough room to manoeuvre. If a 6 ' by 4 ' table is used either reduce the number of units on each side or alter the deployment of each main battle line to ensure that it fits on the table .
