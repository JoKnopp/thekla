I actually only use VS.net for php ( and only started after getting vs.php ) so I 'm not totally familiar with all of its functionality. But it would be extremely nice if one could individually deploy a file via ftp. ie , a small change is made , right click and deploy. that way user would n't have to wait for it to check all other files for sync and such. also , whenever i deploy a project , it deploys the .proj file even though it is not included in my project .
