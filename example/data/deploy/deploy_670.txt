[ 0043 ] When WebSphere.RTM. 6.01 is to be supported , a new template is not introduced , but the existing template is updated to accommodate the differences. The update is performed because the differences in two release versions are small from the point of view of management. The active objects derived from the template may manage a WebSphere.RTM. 6.0 container as well as a WebSphere.RTM. 6.01 container. Similarly , if initially WebSphere.RTM. 6.0 is to be deployed only on Linux.RTM. platforms , the template for WebSphere.RTM. 6.0 has the information for managing the container on Linux.RTM. platforms only. If later , WebSphere.RTM. 6.0 is to be deployed and supported on Windows.RTM. platforms as well , the template for WebSphere.RTM. 6.0 needs to be updated to add this capability , which is an example of changing the scope of a template .
