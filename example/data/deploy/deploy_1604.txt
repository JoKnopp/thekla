How could you have avoided this conundrum ? By using DFS , of course ! Before you deploy Office ( or any other software ) using Group Policy , create a new DFS root on your network and create a DFS link to the shared folder from which you are going to deploy Office; in the above scenario , this is \\TEST220\OfficeInstallFiles. For example , to create a domain-based DFS root for the forest2.com domain , you would open the DFS console and right-click on the root node to start the New Root Wizard. Then proceed through the wizard , selecting the domain root option and specifying the server that will host your DFS root. Type a name for your root and a description ( Figure 2 ) , and finish the wizard by specifying a shared folder for your new DFS root. A good tip here is to create a new hidden share ahead of time for your DFS root. This can be done by appending $ to the share name; that way , users wo n't be able to browse the DFS root directly using My Network Places .
