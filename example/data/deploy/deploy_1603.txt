Hardly had the G8 summit ended in Evian when another important event in international politics impended. The heads of foreign policy departments of the Russia-NATO council are to hold a meeting in Madrid. The meeting will be even more pressing against the background of the USA 's intention to perform the most massive redeployment of its troops since WWII. More importantly , a very large part of American troops is going to be deployed closer to Russian borders. In fact , this is not a sensational piece of news. Before the military operation was launched in Iraq , it was known that the White House and the Pentagon were going to abolish some of their bases in Western Europe. According to an official point of view , Washington is going to deploy its troops to Poland , Romania and Bulgaria in order to be closer to the Middle East region. Yet , there is also an unofficial point of view , which says that the American administration wants to get even with obstinate European allies who protested against the Iraqi war. One way or another , the American presence in Eastern Europe is going to increase considerably in the nearest future - that 's a fact .
