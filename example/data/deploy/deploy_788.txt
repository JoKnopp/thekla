Your installer package must register the SSCProt.dll with the Windows system , and ( as usual ) it can deployed in the directory where you would normally place shared components or dlls. ( See your installers documentation for instructions how to register dlls ) . Note , by contrast , when using IronWrapping you do not have to deploy the ClientProtector , even if you access it just like a regular COM server since it is virtualized to your application .
