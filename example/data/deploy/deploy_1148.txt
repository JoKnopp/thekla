[ 0034 ] The illustrative embodiments provide management services to maintain the deployed services in a desired state and take corrective actions when the service state deviates from the desired state. In response to an alert pertaining to a particular service , the management services in the embodiments automatically trigger analysis to determine the cause of the alert , determine if an alternate resource or supporting service needs to be used , and redeploy the managed services using alternate resources and/or services. These management services are scalable , inherently autonomic , and may manage services for multiple platforms .
