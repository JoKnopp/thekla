DNSSEC is a colossal flop , but not a mistake. It 's an embarrassment , but we 'd do it all again if we had to. It 's late -- it was started years before the IPv6 effort but is ( believe it if you can ) even less finished and less deployed than IPv6. It 's ugly and complicated and if we knew then what we know now we'd 've scrapped DNS itself and started from scratch just to avoid the compromises we 've made. But we did n't know then , etc. , and what we have to do now is avert our gaze and fully deploy this ugly embarrassing thing .
