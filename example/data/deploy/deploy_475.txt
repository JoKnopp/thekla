When they came under the fire of Moller 's guns , the Allied squadrons , which now lay north of Reichardtswerben and well ahead of their own infantry , suffered somewhat heavily; but it was usual to employ heavy guns to protect a retreat , and they contented themselves with bringing some fieldguns into action. They were , however , amazed when von Seydlitz 's thirty-eight squadrons suddenly rode down upon the head and right flank of their columns from the Polzen Hugel avec une incroyable vitesse. Gallantly as the leading German regiments deployed to meet him , the result was scarcely in doubt for a moment. Von Seydlitz threw in his last squadron , and then himself fought like a trooper , receiving a severe wound. The mel e drifted rapidly southward , past the Allied infantry , and von Seydlitz finally rallied his horsemen in a hollow near Tagewerhen , ready for fresh service. This first episode took only half an hour , and by that time the Prussian infantry , in echelon from the left , was descending the Janus Hugel to meet the already confused and disheartened infantry of the Allies .
