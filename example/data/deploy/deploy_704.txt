Once you have set up the reference system and before you deploy you software to it , create a snapshot of your VM. This can be either done by duplicating the machines disk image or by the Virtual Machines own ' snapshot ' feature. The important point , is that you can revert the VM to its original pre-deployment state easily. Uninstalling the deployed software is not an equivalent option if it installs any libraries or changes system settings .
