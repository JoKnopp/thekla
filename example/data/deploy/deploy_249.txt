Today , I read about the Army mom who refused to deploy to Afghanistan because she had nobody to care for her 10-month-old boy. As a result , she might face criminal charges. Alexis Hutchinson , 21 , says the only family she had who could pitch in , her mom , was already caring for other relatives with healthy problems. According to her lawyer , one of her superiors knew about the situation , and said she 'd have to deploy anyway and put her son in foster care .
