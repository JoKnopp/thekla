Say that you have an OU that contains all of the workstations. Furthermore , you have five applications that you want to deploy via GPO. I must admit that I have always created five GPOs - one for each application. Forgetting everything else , can I create one GPO and deploy those five applications from that one GPO ? I do not currently have a test environment available to me so I can not test this. So , I ask ! I am pretty sure that this is possible but want to ask .
