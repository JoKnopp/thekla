In order to add greater redundancy to its worldwide GSOC operations , Microsoft intends to provide communications interoperability between the different radio systems deployed around the world and WAVE software has been chosen to provide this unique capability. Once WAVE is operational by mid-2009 , each of Microsoft 's three GSOCs will have the ability to assume full control of another 's security operations for whatever reason , with full communications interoperability between radio systems. Microsoft will also be able to leverage advanced Unified Communications and collaboration capabilities with a fully integrated console solution .
