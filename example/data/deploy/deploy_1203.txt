Your installer package must put the distributed license file ( Main License File ) in a location that can be determined by your application either in absolute terms or relative to the host applications directory. For simplicity we recommend that you deploy it to the same directory as the host application executable. ( See the StartUp function in the ClientProtector Reference for information about relative vs. absolute paths of the Main License File . )
