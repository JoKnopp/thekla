What I honestly believe is that most of the people in this seed are assuming and asserting things as fact when its all really conjecture. My brother and his wife both are in the military. Prior to both of them being deployed to Afghanistan they thought that she might be pregnant. They had only one option for childcare and that was me. Right now my fiance and I live in a one bedroom apartment and it wouldnt have been feasible for me to take on a newborn. I was there only choice , she has an elderly grandmother that couldnt care for a child and neither of them would trust any other family member or friend with their child .
