To create the HOST service principals manually , you need to use the ADSI editor. Open the ADSI editor and navigate to your server computer object. Navigate to the Optional servicePrincipalName attribute and add both the HOST/server and HOST/server.domain.com values. Set this value on all server computer objects that will be hosting shares for software deployment. Client workstations the software will be deployed on do not need to be modified .
