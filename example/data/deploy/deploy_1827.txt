The reduced error checking is a direct result to that no compilation is performed and hence some errors may be discovered by your users later. The initial page load slowness is also because nothing is compiled yet and the entire web application has to be compiled at the time the first page is being requested. An advantage of this technique over the XCOPY deployment is that you have the options to deploy to the File System , the Local IIS , the FTP Sites , and the Remote Sites. Please see figure 1 .
