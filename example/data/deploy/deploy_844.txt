[ 0006 ] Traditional methods for configuration and deployment of software components rely heavily upon domain experts ' knowledge about the component requirements , availability of middleware and the underlying infrastructure , and overall IT environment. Using this background knowledge , a system administrator is first required to configure the existing infrastructure and then customize the configuration and deployment steps for a new component , so the new component can be deployed successfully.

Further , such an approach does not lend itself to automation as system administrators are key components in the deployment workflow .
