A very touching photo. However when she signed her enlistment contraact and raised her hand to swear to obey all legal orders of her superiors she knew that she would very likely be deployed at some point during her enlistment. She should be charged with disobeying a legal order and missing movement. I do n't think that jail time is in order but she should be removed from the service with a less than honorable discharge. She should not be qualified to recieve any veteran benefits for the rest of her life. She did not honor her enlistment commitment like thousands/millions of service personnel have over the years. She has not earned any benefits what-so-ever .
