Acronis Universal Deploy Universal Deploy provides a simple way for you to deploy new systems with different hardware. A standard configuration image can easily be deployed to identical hardware. However , while this method works for systems with the same hardware , it can fail with machines running different hardware. Systems in such cases may fail to boot because the critical Hardware Abstraction Layer ( HAL ) and mass storage device drivers are missing. While Microsoft SysPrep technology allows you to import plug-and-play drivers , such as sound , video , and network drivers , it does not allow you to import the drivers required to boot the machine .
