LtGen Egon Ramms : It is a strange feeling to make the plans and preparations for the mission and to know that you will have to hand over in mid December 2006 and somebody else will be going to Afghanistan to deploy with the Corps. I wish I could go with the MNC NE to Afghanistan but a Polish successor will be commanding the HQ MNC NE at the time. However , I will be the commanding officer at JFC in Brunssum and I will try to take care of this Corps HQ because JFC Brunssum is the Operational Command for the Afghanistan mission. Obviously , I will visit the HQ ISAF in Kabul and I will meet the officers , non-commissioned officers and privates deployed to Afghanistan whom I shall remember from Szczecin. That helps a little bit .
