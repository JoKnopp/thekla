During the past three years , we have streamlined MPC software development by adopting strategies and tools borrowed from the commercial world. These include short development cycles , agile development methods , automated unit tests , trackable work scoping and milestones , and systematic code review. We use open source tools and platforms wherever they do the job without compromise , yet we pay for commercial tools when they offer a compelling advantage over that which is freely and publicly available. Accordingly , we have standardized on Java and GNU C++ as our development languages. We deploy our software in Linux and Solaris environments and use the Apache and Tomcat web servers to make our projects available to the public. We use the MySQL 4.1 relational database engine; the CVS and Subversion source control and version management systems; ANT , make , and CruiseControl for build automation; and RT , a request-tracking and trouble ticket management software. All of these systems are open source and incur no recurring license costs .
