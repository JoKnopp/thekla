If customizations have been performed , we can expect additional maintenance requirements. This is more so when updates/patches/upgrades to the software tool are received. Applying an update or upgrading to a later version could involve significant work including backing-up and re-applying any customizations , testing and re-deploying the tool. Even when there are no customizations , moving to a later version can pose compatibility issues and requires testing before deploying widely. While the vendor personnel may offer support , the organization will also need its own resources to work with the vendor on software tool maintenance activities and support .
