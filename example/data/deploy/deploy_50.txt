With the Introduction of Anakin this game is almost done and dusted. I still have the numerical supremacy so I will be able to survive this turn but will most likely lose all but one of my units unless I roll all hits when attacking Anakin. If I am to have any chance I will need a high build roll and draw a space unit or another Security escort as I wo n't have enough build to deploy Durge. I 'm glad now Shaun only has one space unit left but that is the only shining light of my underground headquarters where hopefully I can hide and fight it out another turn .
