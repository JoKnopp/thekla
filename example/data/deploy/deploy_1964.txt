For purposes of the deploying the software/content on the device , the server must establish a data connection session. There are at least two ways of establishing a data session with the device. One approach is the use of a notification message that can be sent to the device using SMS or IP. Upon receipt of the notification message , the mobile device will connect to the server and receive the software/content to be deployed. In the second approach , the server can directly establish a connection with a device , if the device is willing to accept a data session from a server. In this case , a web server or listener should be operational on the device so that incoming requests for data sessions can be handled .
