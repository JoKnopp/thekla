The estimated cost to deploy new defensive systems for Army aircraft in Iraq is $ 228 million $ 78 million would be needed in 2004 and $ 150 million in 2005. That will pay to accelerate the production of the ATIRCM ( advanced threat infrared countermeasures system ) and the SIRCM ( suite of infrared countermeasures ) . A senior Army official briefing reporters last month said that , so far , the service reprogrammed $ 28 million to pay for those new systems , but that it would seek help from the Office of the Defense Secretary or supplemental congressional appropriations for the remaining $ 200 million. As a last resort , the Army would take the funds from other programs .
