Of course , Microsoft already has various mechanisms for deploying software automatically , from SUS for updates to SMS to Group Policy Software Installation. However , the N.S.S. interface makes deployment simple. You merely select the location of the software to be deployed and the computers on which you want to install the software ( or configure filters that will allow you to deploy the software based on which computers have specified operating systems or applications installed ) . You can select to deploy the software immediately or set a date and time for it to be deployed. You can choose whether the computers should be rebooted after the software is installed , whether to send a warning message to the user before deploying the software , whether to stop services first and whether to delete copied files from the target computer after deployment ( See Figure 3 ) .
