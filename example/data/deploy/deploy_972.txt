Corporal Bryan Casler was first deployed to Iraq with the Marines in 2003 , at the time of the invasion. Posted to Afghanistan in 2004 , he returned to Iraq for another tour of duty in 2005. He tells of other low-level versions of the tactic of avoidance : " There were times we would go to fix a radio that had been down for hours. It was purposeful so we did not have to deal with the bullshit from higher [ ups ] . In reality , we would go so we could just chill out , let the rest of the squad catch up on some rest as one stood guard. It 's mutual and people start covering for each other. Everyone knows what the hell 's going on. "
