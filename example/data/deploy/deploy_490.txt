The NI TestStand Deployment Utility is tightly integrated with LabVIEW facilitating the deployment of the VIs that make up your test system. One of LabVIEW ' s biggest benefits is that it is inherently modular. Although LabVIEW applications can be compiled into monolithic executables , they can still be executed and maintain their modular nature as VIs. The NI TestStand Deployment Utility focuses on facilitating the collection of all necessary VIs. The deployment utility analyzes all of the LabVIEW VIs that it deploys to determine their complete hierarchies , including all subVIs , DLLs , external subroutines , run-time menus , LabVIEW Express configuration diagrams , and help files that your VIs may reference. It then packages these VIs and their hierarchies to ensure that they will be executable on systems that do not have the LabVIEW development system installed. Now that the deployment image has been created , the next step is to actually deploy this image onto your test machines using one of the three methods described below .
