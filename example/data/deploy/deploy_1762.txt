Instead we deploy them manually when setting up a PC. DisplayLink IT uses the publicly available Corporare Install files , which are distributed as MSIs. This allows you to do silent , automated installs of our software without having to accept a EULA each time. For ease , I use AutoIT to do the actual installation as it ' s nice and flexible , and we tend to buy laptops on an ad-hoc/purpose specific basis , so Drive Imaging would consume more time than it would save !
