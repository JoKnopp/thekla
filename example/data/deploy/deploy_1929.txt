This man is no coward , but he is certainly no hero either. That term is used very loosely and most of the time its not true. He is honorable and making an honorable decision. He is not letting his brothers down in combat or in a combat zone , he is not refusing to deploy at all , he is simply saying from his home that having been there he does n't believe its right and he refuses to go back .
