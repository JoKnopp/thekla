" Amongst the most potent of all our capabilities in deterring and denying the insurgency is our ability to project Close Air Support. In Afghanistan we have a contingent of Harrier GR7/GR9s that have proven time and again their value in defending the lives of our troops , our Allies and those they are there to protect. The Harrier Force first deployed to Kandahar Airfield in November 2004 and continuously has been operational ever since. This is an impressive record by any standard but I am very mindful of the strain that this extended deployment has put upon the crews , their families and the wider roles of Joint Force Harrier. I have therefore decided to withdraw the Harrier Force by Spring 2009 and to replace them with an equivalent force of Tornado GR4s .
