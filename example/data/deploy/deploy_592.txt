Note the option to uninstall the application when it falls out of the scope of management. If this is chosen , and the GPO that deployed the software no longer applies ( for example if a user or computer object was moved ) , then the software would be automatically uninstalled. The installation user interface options allow you to control how much interaction the user will have during the installation process .
