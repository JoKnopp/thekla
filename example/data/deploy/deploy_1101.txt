The response , from both open source and commercial software developers , is a new category of tools for Software Production Management that addresses the full range of build , package , test and deploy processes. Software Production Management contrasts with Software Creation ( the process of creating new software ) that for many years has seen rapid innovation in its toolset ( i.e. source code control , editors , debuggers , etc. ) . Only recently have Software Production Management tools covering the full range of processes become available or even necessary. The combination of web-based interfaces ( which can be trivially deployed throughout an organisation ) and cost-effective rack-mounted servers means that advanced tools can leverage large clusters of cheap machines and make that power available through a familiar web-based interface hiding the underlying complexity of the system .
