This mid-level system builds on the capabilities of Fusionplus with increased functionality and number of users while accommodating the need for high-volume form processing. Forms can be designed and processed at any number of locations across the enterprise and even deployed electronically - to the web , tablet PCs and PDAs for completion by mobile workers. The software will process complex , structured paper forms and , in some instances , semi-structured documents. Once processed , the captured information can be exchanged with other business systems via the Application Programming Interface ( API ) .
