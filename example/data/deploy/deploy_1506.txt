Since you know so much , you should also know that this woman was granted six to eight weeks of paid maternity leave after giving birth , that she was on limited duty from her 20th week of pregnancy , that she was deferred from deployment automatically for four months ^^and^^ she had the option of leaving the service as a consequence of pregnancy -- but she chose to stay , knowing that the Army was in deployment mode. How long have we been deploying to Iraq and Afghanistan ? This is n't a surprise to anyone .
