If you have n't heard , with AuthAnvil v2 we are now able to deploy to both 32bit and 64bit Windows Server platforms for both our Strong Authentication Server and all the applicable agents. We have also released a new Credential Provider for Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 , and added a new administrative web service which allows you to now do much of your standard AuthAnvil admin directly with PowerShell !
