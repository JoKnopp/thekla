Figure C-1 helps illustrate several points about deployment. First , it shows why mixed air and sea deployments -- rather than pure air deployments -- are used for any large force. The capacity of sealift is so big relative to that of airlift that beyond the first two weeks of an operation ( when no ships will have arrived yet ) , sealift will always provide a greater percentage of the total lift capacity than airlift will. That is especially true in real-world situations with limited MOG. In this example , a heavy division plus all of its EAD support units , with about 180 , 000 tons of unit equipment , require about 25 to 30 days to deploy , using prepositioned equipment. Attempting to deploy the same force purely by air would take 35 to 40 days in the absence of MOG limitations and 180 to 185 days with MOG limitations .
