Considering the present political situation , the CPB leaders said , the interim government 's decision to deploy the army was not only irrelevant , but could also be viewed as a direct provocation that will further complicate the crisis. The President and General Secretary of the CPB also said that the government 's hesitation to implement its " Package Proposal , " its open partiality and bias towards war criminals and autocratic forces , along with the President 's deceitful maneuvering , have already aroused massive frustration and apprehension among all sections of the people about the present state of politics in Bangladesh. Furthermore , they said , the interim government 's actions have also created a real danger to the continuity of the democratic process and democracy itself. If the decision for deployment of the army proves to have been made on the basis of partisan political considerations , it will definitely exacerbate and increase the present danger .
