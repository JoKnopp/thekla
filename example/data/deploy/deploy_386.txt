well , I 'm in agreeance , if she could n't find another person to take care of her kid , then she should n't have been deployed and/or discharged. But who 's to say that other women would n't get pregnant just for the sake of not being deployed. But to criminally charge that woman is sickening really. pretty complicated issues..
