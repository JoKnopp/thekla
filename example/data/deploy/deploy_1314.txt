The rover , named Sojourner , will rise to its full height and deploy its communications antennas. Next the lander imager and the weather station will deploy to their full heights , and the imager will scan the horizon. Once the first panorama of Mars has been sent back to Earth , Sojourner will power up and venture out onto the surface for a closer look. The rover will use lasers and cameras to detect rocks and other surface objects in its path as it moves about the surface. Its chassis incorporates a rocker-bogie suspension system , very stable and flexible for scaling rocks nearly half its own height. Objects too big to drive over will be circumnavigated .
