When she enlisted , she did not have a child. She became pregnant by another soldier , who she will not identify , while a member of the U.S. military. Tax dollars paid for her prenatal care , the birth of her son , the after birth care of her son. She is a non-combatant , cook. She would not be in a combat zone. She has a duty she signed up for , but ca n't hold up to her end of the contract. Her son was at one time in the care of her mother , however the timing of the grandmother not being able to care for her grandson , as the mother deploys , is suspect. There are many qualified , hard working , female members of our armed forces. This example is not the norm , but an exception on how it is abused .
