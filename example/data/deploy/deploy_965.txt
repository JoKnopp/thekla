This is what happens when you require a single mother with no one left to care for her son to depart the country for a war zone. This should have been addressed earlier by her chain of command starting with her sergeant major. She should have been effectively removed from deployment status until the situation was resolved or she is honorably discharged if she requested a discharge. Otherwise she should have been forced to remain stateside and an alternate soldier deployed from another list. This is what happens in the Army I know I was in the Army and worked in administration for 5 years. This is a complete pass the buck deal onto the soldier ' s backpack. Even though she has done nothing wrong; she did not report for deployment; even though they knew she would not be able to deploy. I guess when it comes to your son or the Army the Son should always win. Thankyou for taking care of your main responsibility; the Army will find another troop to discipline just like you have been- unjustly .
