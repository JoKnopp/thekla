Why am I telling you this ? Well , for two reasons. First , if you have some piece of software that you need to install throughout a domain or enterprise , you should make sure you build an MSI installation so you can take advantage of this feature. Just knowing that this feature exists is useful ! Second , you need to realize that if your software is deployed this way , it will be installed under one security context ( and a highly privileged one at that ) and run under a different ( restricted ) security context : the user of the workstation where your software is installed. So , as I discussed toward the end of HowToDevelopCodeAsANonAdmin , be sure you design your application with these two security contexts in mind. Your installer program should n't be messing with any settings in the user profile ( WhatIsAUserProfile ) , for example , because it wo n't be running in the security context of any legitimate user who will be using the application. It will most likely be running as SYSTEM. Keep these deployments in mind when writing installers .
