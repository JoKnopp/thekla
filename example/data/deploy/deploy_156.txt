While the Army pretends to " lighten up " , it still devotes half of its operations and maintenance budget for ground equipment to keep its fleet of 5000 General Dynamics M1A1 tanks combat ready for World War III. The Army deployed fewer than 2000 M1A1 tanks to Saudi Arabia for the 1991 Iraq war , but only a few hundred saw any action. Heavy tanks are vital , but are expensive to maintain and difficult to move. Unfortunately , Shinseki has done nothing to shed expensive surplus tanks , and has presented no plans to lighten or move any of the Army 's six heavy divisions. In contrast , Shinseki 's primary goal is to buy thousands of expensive General Dynamics armored cars to " heavy up " light infantry brigades. The US Congress and the American media were shocked that General Eric Shinseki wasted millions of dollars to outfit the Army with new hats. They should not be surprised that he plans to squander billions of dollars implementing a growth strategy for General Dynamics to make the US Army more costly and less mobile .
