[ 0031 ] The plan generator 206 can be configured to identify a set of target computing devices having the live state different from the desired state. In addition , the plan generator 206 can be configured with logic to generate a plan script that includes computer commands that deploy one or more software components of a complex software package to each computing device in the set of target computing devices. As a result , the live state of each computing device in the set of target computing devices can be changed to the desired state. As such , the plan script can include deployment commands to call one or more functions that when executed , deploy software components to target computing devices and/or infrastructure resources .
