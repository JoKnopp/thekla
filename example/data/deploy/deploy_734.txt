Contributing to this simplicity is the development of a common hardware and software platform that supports multiple control disciplines , such as motion , drives , and discrete components , and both rotary or linear-motor types. Machine builders can now employ a single common-control platform that can deploy the software developed for one application across a variety of controllers within the platform family .
