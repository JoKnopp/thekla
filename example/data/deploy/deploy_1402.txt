beaches4me , I served 23 years on active duty and can testify that not all are bad , and I would go one step more and say most aren't. I was a single parent for a few years and did what I had to do to serve because I had a choice. We all know the regs. My question for you is have you and your husband been deployed at the same time , or know for a fact you will be deployed at the same time ? Not always , but in most cases the military will not deploy both parents at the same time if they have a choice. If you both truly want to continue to serve I hope your situation changes , and more importantly do your best to plan and do n't give up unless there is no other option. I wish you the best of luck .
