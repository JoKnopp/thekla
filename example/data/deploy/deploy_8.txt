Next month Kissimmee plans to deploy the software on a public kiosk at City Hall providing ready access to building and zoning information offering on-line payment of fees. " The goal is to reduce our existing level of walk-in traffic , from 10 , 000 people per year to a more manageable level , thus freeing our staff from repetitive inquires. We ' re even looking at installing kiosks at Home Depot , said Steigerwald , " to make life easier for our community 's homeowners and developers. "
