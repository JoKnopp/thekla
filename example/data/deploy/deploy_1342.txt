Software deployment consists of several steps. Building the binaries , gathering the additional files and packaging on the development system , unpacking and distributing the files to their places on the user system. The last two steps are usually done by software package management systems such as Installshield or RPM packages. However , providing these systems with the right collection of files and settings can be a very complex task , depending on your software. Copying them from your development system , updating setting templates , retrieving the latest documentation files from the version control system.. Every step of those can either be forgotten or handled improperly. The result is an faulty deployment package. Deploying an outdated documentation would be one of the lesser problems you can face .
