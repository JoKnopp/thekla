To deploy your software that uses Outlook Security Manager you should include the secman.dll file in your setup package and register it on an end-user computer as a COM object. To register it you can use the regsvr32 utility or special options of your installer ( for example , vsdrfCOMSelfReg ) . In addition , your setup package must include SecurityManager.dll ( SecurityManager.2005.dll ) that must be located in the application install folder .
