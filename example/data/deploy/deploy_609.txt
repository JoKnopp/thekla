It would be tough to argue that the quality goals for a software project , no matter how small , and the decisions made during its development should always include an appropriate degree of thought and analysis regarding quality requirements. I find it reasonable , even preferable , that the entire framework for defining , managing , measuring , developing , delivering and deploying software should be discussed in the context of quality. This stems from the premise that the definition ( or measure ) of software quality is much more than just the number of bugs found during QA , or how many support calls are received during BETA. In my view , everything from the number of bugs found during code reviews , the development schedule , and even the end user 's price can be discussed in the context of meeting software quality goals .
