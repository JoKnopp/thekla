Tech. Sgt. Leonard Samson , 624th Civil Engineer Squadron , receives one last hug from his son prior to leaving for his deployment at Honolulu International Airport Friday July 31. Sergeant Samson is one of 54 Reservists from the 624th CES , which falls under the 624th Regional Support Group , who are being mobilized to deploy to Afghanistan for six months. This is a " partial " mobilization , meaning half the squadron is being mobilized as opposed to the entire squadron. Once in the AOR , the CE team will be supporting the Army at Bagram.
