A very specific target audience uses " occasionally used applications " and those applications do n't get used very often. Suppose that you deploy a mission-critical application to a company and employees use it around the clock , but managers only want to peek at stats once a month. In that case , the managers ( " occasional users " ) may prefer a Web interface they can browse to no matter where they are at and what computer they are on. In fact , the usage profile of occasional users are practically identical with public users , expect that you likely know who they are .
