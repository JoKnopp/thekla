There 's nothing wrong with a woman wanting to serve her country , but I 'm personally of the opinion that pregnancy should end , or at least indefinitely postpone military service. It 's hard enough juggling work and family if you happen to work a normal civilian job , but if your job requires you to dodge terrorist fire deep in the Middle East , maybe you 're not ready to be a mommy. The US Military disagrees however , and according to statistics , over 40 , 000 single mothers have been deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan since 9/11 .
