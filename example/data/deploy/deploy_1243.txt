Entering FY 84 , the Army worked to resolve two major problems that hindered the combat capability of heavy and light forces lift and sustainment. The Air Force and Navy did not have the transportation resources to deploy the Army 's forces in a timely manner either by air or sea. Once Army troops arrived in the area of conflict , sustainment requirements like food , fuel , ammunition , replacement personnel , and spare parts placed another heavy burden upon the already overextended U.S. lift capacities. Attempting to solve these problems , Army planners and logisticians pre-positioned POMCUS ( pre-positioned materiel configured to unit sets ) stores and war reserve stockpiles in Europe and deployed units in likely regions of conflict to reduce the lift requirements and improve the sustainment capabilities of Army forces in wartime. These actions altered the Army 's force balance , funding allocations , force structure , logistics , and doctrine and allowed the Army to employ finite resources to meet its worldwide missions and obligations .
