Deploying applications requires coordination across many different groups and many different systems. It 's easy to fumble handoffs. You spend time checking and double-checking , or even re-dos. We help you dramatically increase efficiency and reliability by standardizing and automating your path to production. Your development teams use different SCM tools. Every team hands off software in different ways , leaving you to figure out how the puzzle pieces fit together. No one is managing dependencies. It does n't have to be so complicated. We collect code from any source , track the dependencies between various packages , manage your testing and verification processes , and securely deploy code to production. It does n't matter your production environment is a mix of Windows , Linux , mainframe , or anything else. We do it all in one tool at one location , with one push button..
