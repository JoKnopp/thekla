Frederick had no intention either of forming up parallel to the enemy or of retreating. As his army could move as a unit twice as fast as the enemy 's , he intended to make a detour , screened by the Janus Hugel and the Plzen Hugel , and to fall upon them suddenly from the east. If at the moment of contact the Allies had already formed their line of battle facing north , the attack would strike their right flank; if they were still on the move in column eastwards or north-eastwards , the heads of their columns would be crushed before the rest could deploy in the new direction -- deployment in those days being a lengthy affair. To this end General von Seydlitz , with every available squadron , hurried eastward from Rossbach , behind the Janus Hugel , to the Plzen Hugel; Colonel von Moller , with eighteen heavy guns , came into action on the Janus Hugel at 315 against the advancing columns of the Allied cavalry; and the infantry followed as fast as possible .
