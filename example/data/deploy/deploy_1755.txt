The number of personnel from the reserve component who would need to be mobilized and deployed for that major combat operation is based on the assumption that all of the combat units used in the operation would come from the active component. Consequently , the number of reserve personnel who would have to be mobilized and deployed to support the operation would include however many reserve personnel would need to be mobilized for EAD support units. Alternatives that place greater or lesser reliance on the reserve component for EAD support units will have greater or lesser need for reserve mobilization. Similarly , alternatives that require a smaller number of EAD support units will require less reserve mobilization. Because this measure includes only reserve personnel who would be mobilized and deployed , it excludes personnel backfilling for deployed active forces. As long as the Army continues the practice of backfilling , any major combat operation will necessitate that some reserve personnel be mobilized ( but not deployed overseas ) for that purpose .
