At the same time , then-Army Chief of Staff Gen. Eric Shinseki reckoned that he needed an interim force , something that was a step beyond the Cold War systems and provided a window into the future , yet allowed for at least marginal force modernization. The expression of this impulse was the eight-wheeled Stryker vehicle. The Army has built six brigades based upon the Stryker , with about 300 variants in each unit. Like the Abrams and Bradley , these legacy vehicles will be around for decades to come. They have also performed exceptionally well in Iraq , overcoming worries about their lesser armor Strykers have been fitted with a number of add-on kits to protect them against rocket-propelled grenades and other threats and winning kudos for their tactical and operational mobility and proving their reliability. This summer , a Stryker brigade will be the first mounted U.S. unit to deploy to Afghanistan .
