70 , 000 soldiers are single parents - if you say any single parent can just get out of deploying , that they do n't have to ship out if they do n't want to - YES , that is going to break army statistics for deployment ! 5 of the military with a right to say no thanks to being deployed ? And a message to all responsible soldiers that they 're screwed , that much more likely to be deployed overseas , because the irresponsible ones get to say No .
