I was a Platoon Segeant for women soldiers while assigned to Ft. Bragg , NC about 17 years ago. If she honestly has no one to take care of her child while she is deployed let allow her a General Discharge and keep moving. I know that the " Army " can allow this soldier to move on with her life and not make her an example. If the military can allow Generals to work as consultants for the service and not be a conflict to the services I am sure that they can allow an elisted member who is pregnant to get out .
