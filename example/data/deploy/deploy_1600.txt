" Mr Speaker the first objective of these force adjustments is to increase the protection that we are able to give our brave servicemen and women as they conduct their mission in Afghanistan. In the months ahead we will deploy more troops to man the additional Viking and Mastiff vehicles that we have already ordered. Further specialists will deploy to man reconnaissance and warning systems in our Forward Operating Bases in Helmand and we will also reinforce the Royal Air Force Regiment Squadron that helps defend Kandahar Airfield. The House will recall that improvements that we have made to ground support and crewing arrangements for our CH-47 Chinook and AH-64 Apache helicopters have increased the total amount of flying time per month available to our commanders in Afghanistan. Part of this uplift will be delivered by an increase in helicopter crews which I am announcing today .
