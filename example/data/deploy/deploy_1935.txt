Momentum is building. DNSSEC is already deployed within Sweden , Brazil , Bulgaria and Puerto Rico. This list of ccTLDs will undoubtedly grow as the next wave of adopters moves from test systems to production. In fact , 85 of ccTLD registries surveyed in October 2007 planned to deploy DNSSEC , and 45 of these planned to deploy within two years. Does this mean that we are done ? Of course not. Yes , we want the root to be signed. Yes , we want end-to-end security. Yes , we want more automated ways to maintain chains of trust. But with these recent developments , real progress can now be made. These early successes will lead to more adoption , ultimately propelling us to that point of critical mass and beyond where eveyone connected to the Internet enjoys the trust that DNSSEC can provide .
