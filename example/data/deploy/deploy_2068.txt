Freedom of Expression : The freedom of opinion and expression " include [ s ] freedom to seek , receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds , regardless of frontiers , " [ fn5 ] and the freedom to choose one 's own medium of expression. The arbitrary use of technological censorship measures to block or prevent access to broad categories of speech and expression including the work of critics , intellectuals , artists , journalists , and religious figures is seldom , if ever , justified by any legitimate governmental objective. And , to the extent that technology enables censorship decisions to be removed from public scrutiny and review , technology-based censorship mechanisms are especially suspect and dangerous to civil society. When repressive governments and other institutions of power seek to deprive people of this basic freedom , people have the right to secure , employ and deploy the tools necessary to reclaim the freedoms to which they are justifiably entitled .
