Sergeant Geoff Millard of the New York Army National Guard served at a Rear Operations Center with the 42nd Infantry Division from October 2004 through October 2005. Part of his duty entailed reporting " significant actions , " or SIGACTS -- that is , attacks on U.S. forces. In an interview in 2007 he told me , " When I was there at least five companies never reported SIGACTS. I think 'search and avoids ' have been going on for a long time. One of my buddies in Baghdad emails that nearly each day they pull into a parking lot , drink soda , and shoot at the cans. " Millard told me of soldiers he still knows in Iraq who were still performing " search and avoid " missions in December 2008. Several other friends deploying or redeploying to Iraq soon assured him that they , too , planned to operate in search and avoid mode .
