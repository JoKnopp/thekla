You can do that. Note that the order in which the packages are handled and installed is kind of random. There 's no logic order it sticks to. If you 're going to deploy three packages and they rely on each other so that you need to have them installed in a certain order , definitely go create different GPOs for them and arrange them accordingly ( in GPMC 's view , they 're applied bottom to top , last writer wins ) .
