Few iWarp hardware components are available on the market , thus little work has been done with them in the high performance computing ( or other any computing communities ) . The impacts on applications , higher-layer protocols , system-area networks , wide-area networks and many other aspects have yet to be analyzed. By having a userspace implementation of iWarp , we can deploy the software on arbitrary machines at no cost and study such aspects at large scale. This advance planning is crucial both to influence evolving hardware designs and to plan for future adoption of high-speed protocol-offload NICs in our computing environments .
