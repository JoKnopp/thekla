So , as I 've wrote previously , today was the day where a proposal to deploy Free Software in the Portuguese Parliement was voted. I knew about it thanks to a document in a non-free format , knew the whole schedule for the day thanks to a document in a non-free format , read the entire proposal , made by Partido Comunista Portugu s , in a document in a non-free format , assisted and recorded it thanks to a video stream in a non-free format , but I wo n't refrain my self to speak out freely my thoughts about it .
