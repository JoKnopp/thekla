This article covers some mixed-environment deployment scenarios , that is , scenarios where you want your Java RIAs to successfully deploy and run in multiple types of environments. For example , you want your applet to deploy and take advantage of the latest Java Plug-In software if that version of the Java Plug-In software is installed. But you also want your applet to successfully deploy if the latest Java Plug-In software is not installed although in that case , the applet wo n't be able to take advantage of the latest Java Plug-In features. In particular , this article shows you how you can use the Deployment Toolkit to successfully deploy and run RIAs in these mixed environments. Note that throughout the remainder of this article the term RIA refers to Java RIAs .
