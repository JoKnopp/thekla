" Before Havok began using Parature , we supported our customers and deployed our products through many different systems including ftp sites , a custom ticketing system and custom FAQ Web pages. Combining the use and maintenance of these disparate systems in a single interface , by way of Parature , has been a real boon for Havok. It has allowed us to grow our support system , while increasing our efficiency and decreasing turnaround times for our customers. "
