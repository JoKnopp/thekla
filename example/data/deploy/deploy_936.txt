The upgrades tab ( shown below ) allows you to automate the deployment of patches and upgrades ( such as newer versions ) to applications that have already been deployed via group policy. If the upgrade is made mandatory ( the required option is selected ) then the upgrade will be applied , and the user will only be able to use the updated version. If it were not made mandatory , then the user would be able to use both the old and new versions of the software. This is potentially useful when a new application is not backwards compatible .
