However , that improved uniformity does not mean that all RIAs run the same way in all user environments or that they can even be deployed in all user environments. Consider Java RIAs , that is , applets and Java Web Start applications. The latter are applications launched by Java Web Start technology. What if your applet requires the latest version of Java Plug-In software or a specific level of the Java Runtime Environment ( JRE ) ? What if your Java Web Start application requires at least a minimum level of Java Web Start software installed ? How do you detect whether the user 's environment satisfies those requirements ? If the user 's environment does not meet your requirements , what actions can you take to ensure that your RIA successfully deploys and runs in those environments ?
