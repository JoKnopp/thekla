By default , the installer program for the software update inventory tools creates two collections for distributing the scan component to client computers : the main collection - called &lt; tool name &gt; ( &lt; site code &gt; ) - and a test collection - called &lt; tool name &gt; ( &lt; site code &gt; ) ( pre-production ) . Also by default , the installer program configures the main collection with membership rules that limit the query used to create it to the test collection. This provides an easy way to test the software update inventory tools prior to deploying them .
