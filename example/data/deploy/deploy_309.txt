Sojourner weighs just 11 kilograms , and stands 45 centimeters tall by 60 centimeters long. Its power source is a top-mounted solar panel , with a maximum capacity of 16 watts. Once the rover has found a rock of interest , it will deploy its Alpha Proton X-ray Spectrometer , and place it against the rock. It will take ten hours to determine the composition of the target. Sojourner will then move on to its next candidate rock. As night falls , the rover will fall silent , and await a new day of exploration with the rising sun .
