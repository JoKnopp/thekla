Master Sgt. Janet Hudson , 624th Regional Support Group Family Support , helps Tech. Sgt. Dedric Brown , 624th Civil Engineer Squadron , with his gear prior to leaving for his deployment at Honolulu International Airport Friday July 31. Sergeant Brown is one of 54 Reservists from the 624th CES , which falls under the 624th Regional Support Group , who are being mobilized to deploy to Afghanistan for six months. This is a " partial " mobilization , meaning half the squadron is being mobilized as opposed to the entire squadron. Once in the AOR , the CE team will be supporting the Army at Bagram.
