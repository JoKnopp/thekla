In a secure domain environment , to prevent chaos and accidental ( or even purposeful ) security breaches , most users do n't have administrative rights on the machines they use. The domain administrator is in charge. So how does software get installed throughout an enterprise if the users themselves do n't install it ? Does the domain administrator roll around on his chair to each workstation installing the software manually using the power of his administrative login ? I hope not ! As of Windows 2000 , a feature known as " IntelliMirror " makes deploying software thoughout a domain ( or an entire enterprise ) considerably easier. This feature is designed to work with the Microsoft Installer , so to get the most out of it you really need to deploy software using MSI files .
