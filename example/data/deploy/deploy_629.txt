[ 0047 ] In some embodiments , once the plan script is generated , and before the plan script is executed , the plan script can be optimized according to one or more rules. An administrator can set up such rules , or configure the optimization module 214 to optimize the plan script according to specific needs of the administrator. For instance , the administrator can choose to execute the plan script in order to deploy software components with minimum target computer infrastructure downtime. In order to achieve this , the execution of the plan script commands can be performed as unobtrusively as possible such that deployment commands are executed with a period of time in between so as to minimize the impact on the target computer infrastructure. In another example , the administrator can choose to execute the plan script with maximum speed .
