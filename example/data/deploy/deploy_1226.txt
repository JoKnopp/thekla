A year ago , IBM delivered DB2 Express-C with the tag line free to build , deploy , distribute. That 's was pretty cool to have a free version of DB2 that includes pureXML and is the same codebase that you get with DB2 Enterprise for Linux and Windows. I really think the best thing here is that you are also free to distribute DB2 Express-C with your application as long as you register that fact with IBM. This is something you do n't get with most open source " free " data servers. With those data servers , if you want to distribute it with your application you have to buy their Enterprise license .
