I do n't under stand why people act the way they do after they signed the " dotted line. " There are many things we did n't know we 'd be doing while in the Army , but deploying was the one thing we did know ! To all the AWOL 's and Anti-war soldiers in service , not only did you joined a military establishment , but most likely you joined after September 11 , 2001 ( a time of war ) . Do you know how stupid that makes you look , when you say and act like this. I hope you guys and gals know what you stand for now , because it 's no longer selfless service and honor .
