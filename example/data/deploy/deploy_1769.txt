Software has become an increasingly indispensable element of a wide range of military , industrial , and business applications. But it is often characterized by high costs , low reliability , and unacceptable delays. Often , they are downright unacceptable ( see Sidebar 1.2 ) . Software life-cycle costs ( LCC ) typically far exceed the hardware costs. Low software quality has a direct impact on cost. Some 40 of software development cost is spent testing to remove errors and to ensure high quality , and 80 to 90 of the software LCC goes to fix , adapt , and expand the delivered program to meet users ' unanticipated , changing , or growing needs.17 While the software costs far exceed hardware costs , the corresponding frequency of failure rate between software and hardware could be as high as 100 : 1. This ratio can be even higher for more advanced microprocessor-based systems.18 Clearly , these are huge issues that can not be addressed effectively by continuing to deploy traditional software development approaches .
