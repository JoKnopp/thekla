God Bless each and every one of those Seabees and their families. When a family member is deployed , his/her whole family and friends are deployed as well. We just do n't leave our homes , just a large part of our lives leave. My son has been at duty stations away from home , being deployed is different , you just ca n't call them and say hi. You wait for every call. It 's a hard and sometimes thankless life. Well let me say THANK YOU !
