Seems like the military should provide military moms with some sort of childcare service. Not foster care , but a program specifically for deployed parents who ca n't find other means of care for their children while overseas. I mean , these people are risking their lives it 's he least the government can do ! I hope the military gets its ethics straight ( right ) and drops the charges because this is wrong on so many levels .
