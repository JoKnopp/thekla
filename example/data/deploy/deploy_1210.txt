" Software is a strategic asset which is embedded in every modern data system and critical business process , " said Mark McGovern , In-Q-Tel 's Vice President of Digital Identity and Security. " It enables innovation and efficiency , but software is also complicated , hard to manage , and often represents the Achilles heel for security which malicious parties use to exploit a system. That makes software security a strategic issue for any enterprise. Integrated capabilities like those coming from Veracode and Signacert 's collaboration will make it easier for enterprises to address this important issue and to deploy solutions for assessing , measuring and managing their software.
