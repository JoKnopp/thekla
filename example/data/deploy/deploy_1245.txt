Once you convert the model into LabVIEW , you can use the wide variety of hardware calls to communicate with physical words through analog I/O , serial , CAN , and so on. You can also deploy code used with this path into real-time targets such as NI CompactRIO or PXI hardware using the LabVIEW Real-Time Module. C code generation using the LabVIEW Microprocessor SDK ( Software Development Kit ) and the LabVIEW Embedded Module for ARM Microcontrollers is also supported .
