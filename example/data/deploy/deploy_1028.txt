Although the graphical user interface ( GUI ) version of Apple Software Restore can be used to deploy a Mac OS X image , the computer receiving the image needs to be booted in Mac OS 9 to run Apple Software Restore. Since almost all Macs introduced after December 2002 no longer boot into Mac OS 9 ( recent iBooks being the exception ) , this tool 's effectiveness is limited. Although a Unix command-line version of ASR is included with recent Mac OS X updates , it can be cumbersome and may require more time at each workstation than older versions of ASR. The only available documentation on the command-line version of ASR can be found in the Unix manual pages by typing " man asr " in Mac OS X Terminal application .
