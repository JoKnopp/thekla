We need to break out of that old cycle of developing monolithic processes only to have them fail to produce the results we anticipated. In an environment where every dollar counts more than ever , we just can not afford a 60 plus failure rate in process redesign. It not only costs us time and money , but also credibility with employees. Use the lessons from software development and build lean , minimum viable processes , deploy them quickly and continuously , and test the results against the old process. Everything you implement wo n't be a success , but when a mistake does occur , you will find it quickly and be able to rapidly make the changes necessary to succeed when you implement the next time around .
