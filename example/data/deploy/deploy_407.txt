Tip : If you are unsure whether a user will use an application that you are deploying , assign the application to the user. The application is advertised , but no files are copied , and hard disk space is not wasted. If the user never starts the application , the adaptive menus that are found in the Windows Server 2003 family will eventually hide the Start menu shortcuts , reducing the complexity of the Start menu .
