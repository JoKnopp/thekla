Is the software duly licensed ? Most software vendors permit STC to deploy fewer copies of their application than workstations in Student Technology Centers as long as concurrent instances of running applications are metered. However , some software vendors require a license for every workstation in the Student Technology Centers. Indiana University may not be able to deploy some applications without institutional licensing , regardless of the terms for individual use. It is the responsibility of the sponsoring department to provide the appropriate Proof of Licensing authorizing deployment in the STC environment .
