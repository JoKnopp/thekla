Initially , Mervyns planned to create its IT infrastructure by duplicating Target 's legacy systems; however , in April 2005 , Mervyns hired Kurt Streitz as its CIO. Streitz proposed that the retailer build its own best-of-breed IT infrastructure. He felt the systems worked well for Target , but they were n't ideal for a midmarket , fashion-oriented retailer. His proposal included implementing a network backbone , creating a data center , hiring IT staff , acquiring all necessary hardware , and deploying and interfacing new software for every aspect of the business merchandising , supply chain , warehouse , POS , financial , HR , and EDI ( electronic data interchange ) systems. By the time Streitz ' proposal was approved , Mervyns had only one year before its IT ' independence day ' was to arrive .
