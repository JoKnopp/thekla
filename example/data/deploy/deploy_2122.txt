In the information systems world we see a different pattern. Information systems start relatively small , and they grow to larger systems when the business can deploy the software successfully to create value. As soon as business starts to use the software , other business prospects emerge leading to updates. When success is spread , so is the software : often such systems are adopted worldwide within globally operating organizations. When the software is in use at many sites , inevitably local modifications are necessary. A local modification can be either a change made by a site , or a site-customized centrally controlled modification. Without proper central governance , only local modifications are made , and the original core system will multiply like a living organism , and after a while a significant number of variants of the system will emerge. We call this phenomenon software mitosis .
