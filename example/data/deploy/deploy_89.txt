This script deploys the appropriate applet using the JNLP file , applet.jnlp. The JNLP file specifies that the Hello6.jar applet requires a JRE in the JRE 6 family. That applet will be deployed to any user environment that has a JRE in the JRE 6 family installed , including environments that the DT upgraded to JRE 6 Update 18 or later. The applet will be able to take advantage of the new JNLP features in user environments that have JRE 6 Update 18 or later installed or where the DT upgraded the user 's environment to JRE 6 Update 18 or later. The script specifies a minimum JRE version of JRE 5 to deploy the Hello5.jar applet. So the Hello5.jar applet will be deployed to any user environment that does n't have a JRE in the JRE 6 family , but at a minimum , has JRE 5 installed .
