Editor ' s Note : President Obama has ordered 21 , 000 more troops to deploy to Afghanistan this summer , seeking to more than double the 32 , 000 deployed in the next few months. The move is controversial inside the military and a handful of soldiers -- like Specialist Victor Agosto of Miami , Fla. -- have refused to deploy. Agosto , who has already served one tour in Iraq , told his superiors that the U.S. military occupation of Afghanistan is immoral and unjust and does not make America safer. He faces a Special Court Martial , with a maximum punishment of one year in prison and a bad conduct discharge. Agosto spoke with NAM editor Aaron Glantz from the U.S. Army base at Fort Hood , Texas .
