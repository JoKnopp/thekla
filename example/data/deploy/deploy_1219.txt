In this article I tried to show you how to automatically deploy the Microsoft ISA Server 2006 Firewall client. It is possible to deploy the Microsoft ISA Server 2006 Firewall client with software distribution programs like Microsoft SMS ( Systems Management Server ) or its successor SCCM ( System Center Configuration Manager ) . In smaller or less complicated IT environments , it is also possible to deploy software by using Software distribution through Group Policies. Deploying the ISA Server 2006 Firewall client is simple , because the download package contains an MSI file which is used for the Software Distribution process. This article does not focus advanced Firewall Client configuration .
