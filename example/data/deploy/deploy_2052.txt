Hopefully Victor , Watada and the other real heroes who refuse to deploy have started a trend. Imagine if 50 , 000 key troops refused to deploy. They would clog the military injustice system until they were sentenced. Then they would be lounging in the stockade and taking up valuable troops to guard &amp;feed them instead of doing the mischief that their criminal leaders order them to do. That might disrupt the grand plans of the greedy political , military , corporate pee brains .
