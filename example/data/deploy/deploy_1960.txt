These notes are divided into three sections , corresponding to the life cycle of the product. The first section represents a log of the trials and tribulations of developing the OSD process covered in this document. Therein lies many obscure tips and tricks that make the hardware independence of the process work. Hopefully , once solved , they will not have to be revisited , but if so , then that section will be invaluable. The second section deals with maintenance of the process; that is , the steps required to create a new image , deploy new hardware , deploy new software , etc. These procedures should be straight-forward and easily reproducible. The final section is notes about upgrading or evolving the process; there probably will not be much in this section at first .
