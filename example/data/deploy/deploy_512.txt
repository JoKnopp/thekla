Well I think turn one was a little disappointing. I was hoping my Homing Missile Salve would roll 4 hits so I could discard the Republic Assault Ship with only one of my Droid Missiles with the other one putting 3 damage counters on one of the Republic Assault Transports. I really have no problems with him using his RAT 's to deploy into Ground as they will focus some of his resources away from the Character arena. I will continue to lay siege via all means necessary against the Space arena and I am hoping to draw some space cards soon !
