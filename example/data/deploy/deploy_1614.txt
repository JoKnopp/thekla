Developing a deployment process early can look like Big Design Up Front if you start out with too detailed of a process that involve guesses about things you just do n't know at the beginning of a project. But remember : you can change the process as you learn. Start with a simple process and change and refactor the process as you go to make it more suitable to the target user 's needs. You may discover that a manual process works well enough , or you may find that adding some automation make the process simpler and lower risk with little added cost. If you have a test team that is using the deployed artifact , you may find that you can leverage automation developed to support test related deployments and use it in your customer process .
