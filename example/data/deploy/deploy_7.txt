Modeling Deployment. CBO began its modeling of deployment by evaluating whether a force could be deployed more quickly between a given origin and destination purely by airlift or with a mixture of airlift and sealift. Pure airlift deployment is a superior option in only a very small number of cases , involving a single light or medium brigade and specific combinations of origins and destinations. For that reason , almost all of CBO 's modeling used mixed airlift and sealift deployments .
