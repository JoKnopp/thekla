We are a military family with 2 returning Iraq veterans; OIF , March 2003 - August 2004 , He deployed to Iraq in his second stop-loss extended 15 month deployment; Dec 2007 - April 2008. Now he has standing orders for deployment to Afghanistan. I believe it is a sacrifice too large to ask of him , his wife and their three children .
