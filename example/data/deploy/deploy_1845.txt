I was humbled to be able to share Thanksgiving dinner with our servicemembers who are spending the holiday away from their loved ones while defending our country abroad , said Congressman Loebsack. During my trip , I was able to meet with many servicemembers , some of whom are about to deploy to Afghanistan , some of whom are stationed in Ramstein , Germany , and others who are recovering at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center. Celebrating our country ' s values over the Thanksgiving holidays with our men and women in uniform was truly inspiring.
