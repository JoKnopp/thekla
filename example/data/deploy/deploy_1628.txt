" The Akamai EdgeComputing powered by WebSphere service enables our customers to pay only for the computing resources they use , allowing them to focus on building profitable applications , rather than the distraction of coping when systems fail , " said Partha Nageswaran , president , Trans-World Resources , an Akamai Solutions Integrator and Enterprise Application Solutions Provider. " The extension of the EdgeComputing service to include integration with WebSphere Studio will provide a much faster and far less complex way to deploy enterprise applications on the edge. "
