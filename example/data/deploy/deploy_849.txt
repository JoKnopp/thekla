The Distributed File System ( DFS ) component of Windows Server 2003 is a powerful tool that can ease the task of deploying and maintaining applications using Group Policy 's Software Installation feature. DFS allows you to create a virtual tree of shared folders that maps to actual shared folders located on different servers throughout your enterprise. From the perspective of ordinary users , DFS makes all shared folders appear to be located on a single shared volume , making it easier for them to find resources on the network. And from an administrator 's perspective , DFS eliminates the worry of having to relocate shared resources when volumes fill up on file servers , something that can create headaches when applications are deployed using Group Policy .
